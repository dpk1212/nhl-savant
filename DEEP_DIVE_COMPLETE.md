**After:** Clear "LIKELY TO DECLINE" with explanation

### **Danger Zone**
**Before:** Just cards with numbers
**After:** "MTL GENERATES MORE HIGH-DANGER SHOTS" with ~0.69 goal impact

### **Rebounds**
**Before:** Confusing side-by-side MTL OFFENSE | CGY DEFENSE
**After:** Clear "MTL OFFENSE → CGY DEFENSE" head-to-head matchup
