# ‚ú® Counter Enhancement - Complete

**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED  
**Commit:** `2d50725` - Feature: Add separate Total Games and +EV Bets counters  
**Date:** October 23, 2025

---

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### **Issue:**
- Header showed "10 GAMES" but page displayed 12 games
- Confusing mismatch between counter and actual games shown
- No way to distinguish total games from +EV opportunities

### **Solution:**
Added **3 distinct counters** with clear labels and color coding:

1. **TOTAL** - Gray (#94A3B8)
   - Shows all games on the page
   - Example: 12 games today

2. **+EV** - Blue (#3B82F6)
   - Shows games with positive expected value bets
   - Example: 10 games have +EV opportunities

3. **ELITE** - Green (#10B981)
   - Shows games with >5% EV (high value)
   - Example: 9 elite betting opportunities
   - Includes pulse animation when > 0

## üîç Related Analysis

This enhancement was implemented during the **away underdog bias analysis**, which revealed:
- 75% of +EV bets are on road teams (9 out of 12 games)
- This may be legitimate early-season market inefficiency
- Tracking results over next 2 weeks to confirm
