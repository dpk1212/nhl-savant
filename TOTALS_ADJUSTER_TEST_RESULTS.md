## Key Findings

❌ **RMSE did not improve** - Adjustments may need tuning

❌ **ML Win Accuracy REGRESSED:** 62.0% (was ~64.7%)

⚠️  **CRITICAL: Do NOT deploy - ML model has been damaged!**

## ❌ RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT DEPLOY

ML accuracy has regressed. Adjustments are affecting core predictions.
Need to debug why ML win rate changed.
