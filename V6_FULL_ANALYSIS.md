# Sharp Intel v6 — Full Analysis

_Auto-generated **6/12/2026, 12:10:01 PM ET** by `scripts/v6FullAnalysis.js`. Do not edit by hand._

**Inclusion mirrors live Pick Performance dashboard:** `lockStage ≠ SHADOW ∧ ¬superseded ∧ health ∉ {MUTED, CANCELLED} ∧ peak.stars ≥ 2.5`. PnL in **peak units** (the size shipped to users) and **flat 1u** (cohort EV lens). Cohort tags from frozen `v8_walletConsensus*` stamps written at last sync before T-15.

## Executive summary

**Sample:** 592 shipped+graded picks · 2026-04-18 → 2026-06-11  (HC analyses scoped to post-cutover 2026-04-30, 480 picks)
**Headline:** 296-288-8 · WR 50.7% [46.6%–54.7%] vs 52.4% break-even · -15.9u flat (-2.7%) · -50.3u peak.
**Overall t-test:** t = -0.66 → ✗ noise.

**Verdict:** ✗ overall sample is consistent with zero or negative true ROI.

### Where IS the edge?

The two real engine-signals are **Δw** (proven-roster directional consensus) and **HC** (high-conviction-wallet margin, post-cutover). Univariate correlations:

- **ρ(Δw, flat ROI) = 0.009 ✗**  (full sample, N=586)
- **ρ(HC, flat ROI) = -0.027 ✗**  (post-cutover, N=480)
- **ρ(Δw+HC, flat ROI) = -0.059 ✗**  (post-cutover, N=480)

Cohort breakdown:

**No cohort cleared the 90% sig threshold. Best directional cohorts:**

**Bleeder cohorts (t ≤ −1.645 with negative mean):**
- **Tier-2 HC ≤ 0 ∧ Δw ≥ +2 (HC era)** — N=79, 33-45, WR 42.3% [32%–53%], flat ROI -20.6% (t=-1.95 ~ p<.10)

### Action map

- **Tier-1a (HC ≥ +2)** — N=41, WR 46.3%, flat ROI -14.1%. Bayesian posterior WR ≈ 47.1%, half-Kelly = **0.0%** bankroll at −110 → **size aggressively**.
- **Tier-1b (HC = +1)** — N=152, WR 55.3%, flat ROI +6.3%. Bayesian posterior WR ≈ 54.9%, half-Kelly = **2.7%** bankroll at −110.
- **Tier-2 (HC ≤ 0 ∧ Δw ≥ +2, HC era)** — N=79, WR 42.3%, flat ROI -20.6%. Δw saves the pick when HC is silent.
- **Δw ≥ +3 (full sample)** — N=102, WR 48.0%, flat ROI -3.1%. Bayesian posterior WR ≈ 48.2%, half-Kelly = **0.0%** bankroll at −110.
- **Stale Δw ≤ 0 (full sample)** — -9.6% flat ROI on 148 picks. Already muted by v7.x; should not re-appear.
- **Sample size:** at observed σ (0.99u/pick), we need **~1505 graded picks** to validate a true +5% flat ROI at 95% confidence. We have 592. Cohort findings — especially HC subsets — are provisional until N grows.

## §1. Sample summary
_Dashboard-truth filter (mirrors live Pick Performance)._

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Date range | 2026-04-18 … 2026-06-11 |
| Sides scanned | 1102 |
| Shipped + graded | **592** |
| W-L-P | 296-288-8 |
| Win rate | **50.7%** [46.6%–54.7%] |
| Break-even WR @ −110 | 52.38% |
| Distance to break-even | WR needs +1.7 pp |
| Peak-units PnL | **-50.3u** |
| Flat-1u PnL | **-15.9u** (-2.7% flat ROI) |
| Flat t-statistic vs zero | -0.66 → ✗ noise |
| Flat 95% CI per-pick | [-0.107, 0.053]u |

### Power note

At our observed flat-PnL standard deviation (0.99u/pick), to detect a true edge of:

| True flat ROI | Picks needed (95% conf) |
|---|---|
| +3% | 4180 |
| +5% | 1505 |
| +10% | 377 |

We have **592** graded picks. Anything we conclude on cohorts smaller than ~200 is provisional.

**Pearson ρ(Δw, WIN) = 0.002** ✗  ·  **ρ(Δw, flat ROI) = 0.009** ✗  (N=586)

### §2b. HC margin — high-conviction proven-wallet margin (post-cutover 2026-04-30)

HC = `hcConfFor − hcConfAg`. "High-conviction" wallets = `CONFIRMED` tier with `sizeRatio ≥ 1.5×` their own median bet. Pre-cutover picks have no HC stamp and are excluded from this analysis (no retro-fit).

| Bucket | N | W-L-P | WR % [95% Wilson] | Flat ROI | Peak PnL | Flat t-stat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HC ≤ −2 | 1 | 1-0-0 | 100.0% [21–100] | +86.2% | +2.5u | 0.00 ✗ n<2 |
| HC = −1 | 22 | 12-10-0 | 54.5% [35–73] | +12.7% | +6.8u | 0.55 ✗ noise |

| HC ≥ +3 | 10 | 3-7-0 | 30.0% [11–60] | -56.7% | -8.8u | -2.57 ✓ p<.05 |

**Pearson ρ(HC, WIN) = -0.007** ✗  ·  **ρ(HC, flat ROI) = -0.027** ✗  (N=480)

Spearman rank ρ(HC, flat ROI) = 0.003.

### §2c. Δw + HC — combined scalar (post-cutover only)

Sum of the two axes the engine actually relies on. Captures the v7.4 lock-floor logic (`HC ≥ +1` OR `Σ ≥ +5`) in a single ranked predictor.

## §4. Proven-wallet feature predictors
_Even without HC / Δw, what do the *characteristics* of the proven wallets on each side tell us? Universe = `CONFIRMED ∪ FLAT` per sport. Δfeature = For-side − Against-side._

Universe N = 565 picks where ≥1 proven wallet appeared on either side.

### §4a. ΔCount — proven-wallet count differential

Crude version: do we win more often when the proven roster is *more numerous* on our side?

### §4b. ΔWlNet — sum-of-(wins − losses) across proven wallets on each side

Each proven wallet brings its own historical W − L record (in this sport). ΔWlNet is `Σwl(For) − Σwl(Ag)`. A high ΔWlNet means the wallets backing our side have collectively won far more games over their tracked history than the wallets backing the opposing side.

### §4e. Sport-rank comparison — best rank on each side

For each pick we look up the BEST (lowest-numbered) sport rank among proven wallets on each side. ΔBestRank > 0 = our side has a *better* (lower-numbered) top wallet than the opposite side.

### §4f. ΔTopQ share — fraction-of-side that's in the sport's top quartile

Top quartile = top 25% of proven wallets in the sport, ranked by flatRoi. Δshare > 0 = our side is more concentrated in elite wallets than the opposite.

## §AGS. Aggregate Score deep dive (point-in-time / out-of-sample)
_Which of the six AGS inputs are pulling the weight, and is the composite earning its place vs. its parts? Numbers below are leakage-free (PIT proven gate + walk-forward calibration)._

### §AGS-0. What AGS is, in one paragraph

AGS aggregates the proven-wallet (`CONFIRMED` ∪ `FLAT`) slice of `peak.v8Scoring.walletDetails[]` into 6 *delta* features (FOR-side minus AGAINST-side), z-scores each one against a daily-recomputed calibration, and **sums the z-scores**. Equal sign-weighted — no fitted coefficients. Thresholds: `AGS ≥ +5` rescues a lock (route C), `AGS ≥ +3` confirms a thin Δw=+1 lock (v7.5 route B), `AGS < -1` mutes an otherwise-locking side (confirmation gate). Sizing multiplier scales [0.5, 1.0]× over [-1, +5].

**In-sample (live production) calibration**: source = `cron`, sampleSize = 1004, dateRange = 2026-04-18 → 2026-06-11, computedAt = 2026-06-12T15:55:37.439Z. _This is what production scores against today; the §AGS-0a audit below shows how much its in-sample numbers diverge from the leakage-free walk-forward version._

### §AGS-0a. Leakage audit — in-sample vs point-in-time / out-of-sample

Two sources of leakage existed in the prior version of this section: (1) a wallet was treated as "proven" if it currently has CONFIRMED/FLAT tier, even for picks made before it earned that status; (2) the AGS calibration normalizers (and the +5/+3/-1 thresholds tuned against them) were computed on data that overlaps with the test sample. The PIT/OOS pass replaces both: it uses a chronological tier lens (proven gate fires only on events strictly prior to the pick date) and walk-forward calibration (mean/SD per feature recomputed at each pick date from prior picks only, cold-started from live calibration when prior N < 30).

Coverage: in-sample AGS computable on **565** rows · PIT aggregate computable on **562** rows (the proven wallet count drops because some wallets weren't yet proven on those early dates) · PIT walk-forward AGS computed on **562** rows (34 used the cold-start fallback calibration for the early dates).

Same rows, same outcomes — only the AGS scoring lens differs:

| Tier | In-sample N · WR · ROI | PIT-OOS N · WR · ROI | Δ ROI (OOS − in-sample) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ELITE (≥+7) | 0 · — · — | 0 · — · — | — |
| LOCK (+5..+7) | 0 · — · — | 0 · — · — | — |
| STRONG (+3..+5) | 0 · — · — | 0 · — · — | — |
| NEUTRAL (0..+3) | 391 · 55% · +5.2% | 332 · 52% · -2.3% | -7.5pp |
| WEAK (−3..0) | 154 · 43% · -15.6% | 213 · 51% · +1.8% | +17.4pp |
| FADE (<−3) | 0 · — · — | 0 · — · — | — |

Production-threshold lift (the rules that actually fire):

| Floor | In-sample fire | PIT-OOS fire | Δ ROI (OOS − in-sample) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AGS ≥ +5 (lock-floor route C) | N=316, WR=56%, ROI=+6.2% | N=252, WR=51%, ROI=-4.2% | -10.4pp |
| AGS ≥ +3 (Δw=+1 confirm route B) | N=391, WR=55%, ROI=+5.2% | N=332, WR=52%, ROI=-2.3% | -7.5pp |
| AGS < −1 (mute veto) | N=54, WR=45%, ROI=-11.7% | N=125, WR=48%, ROI=-2.7% | +9.0pp |

_Reading: a large negative Δ in the LOCK / STRONG rows = the in-sample numbers were optimistically inflated by leakage. A small Δ = the original analysis was directionally honest. The PIT-OOS numbers are what the engine would have produced if every pick had been scored at the moment it was made._

#### §AGS-0a-recent. Last-14-days holdout (PIT-OOS, 2026-05-29 → 2026-06-11, N=228)

The cleanest out-of-sample window — every pick here was scored against a walk-forward calibration computed entirely from prior dates (no cold-start fallback in this slice).

| Tier | N · WR · ROI |
|---|---|
| ELITE (≥+7) | 0 · — · — |
| LOCK (+5..+7) | 0 · — · — |
| STRONG (+3..+5) | 0 · — · — |
| NEUTRAL (0..+3) | 111 · 56% · +4.4% |
| WEAK (−3..0) | 117 · 50% · -1.4% |
| FADE (<−3) | 0 · — · — |

| Floor | Fire (PIT-OOS, last 14d) |
|---|---|
| AGS ≥ +5 (lock-floor route C) | N=75, WR=56%, ROI=+5.3% |
| AGS ≥ +3 (Δw=+1 confirm route B) | N=111, WR=56%, ROI=+4.4% |
| AGS < −1 (mute veto) | N=72, WR=49%, ROI=-2.6% |

### §AGS-1. Coverage + distribution

PIT-OOS AGS computable on **562/592** shipped+graded rows (95%). Rows drop out for two reasons: missing frozen `walletDetails[]` (older docs), or no wallet on either side was yet proven on this pick's date under the strict-prior PIT lens.

**Tier counts (boundaries set in `src/lib/ags.js → agsTierFromValue`):**

| **FADE** | < −3 | 131 | 23.3% |

### §AGS-2. AGS tier × outcome — does the ladder pay?

If the AGS calibration is right, win-rate and flat ROI should rise monotonically up the tier ladder. Sample sizes inside FADE/ELITE will be thin — read the directional signal, not the point estimate.

| Bucket | N | W-L-P | WR % [95% Wilson] | Flat ROI | Peak PnL | Flat t-stat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ELITE | 89 | 44-43-2 | 50.6% [40–61] | -6.7% | -15.4u | -0.68 ✗ noise |
| LOCK | 103 | 48-55-0 | 46.6% [37–56] | -12.1% | -20.1u | -1.28 ✗ noise |
| STRONG | 0 | — | — | — | — | — |
| NEUTRAL | 0 | — | — | — | — | — |
| WEAK | 72 | 37-33-2 | 52.9% [41–64] | +1.7% | +8.7u | 0.15 ✗ noise |
| FADE | 131 | 60-68-3 | 46.9% [38–55] | -4.3% | -33.7u | -0.45 ✗ noise |

### §AGS-3. Per-feature univariate predictive power

Each of the 6 inputs evaluated on its own. `r(WIN)` and `r(ROI)` are the Pearson correlations against win-binary and flat profit; Spearman ρ is the rank-based version (robust to fat tails). The bucketed table partitions on the z-scored feature using the active calibration so a "z ≥ +1" row is exactly what the production AGS sees as a strongly positive contribution.

#### `dCount` (COUNT)

r(WIN) = **-0.021** ✗ · r(ROI) = **-0.048** ✗ · Spearman ρ(ROI) = **-0.050**.

| Bucket | N | W-L-P | WR % [95% Wilson] | Flat ROI | Peak PnL | Flat t-stat |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| z < −1 (very negative) | 119 | 61-56-2 | 52.1% [43–61] | +5.8% | -20.6u | 0.59 ✗ noise |

| z ∈ [−1, 0) | 34 | 15-19-0 | 44.1% [29–61] | -3.2% | -3.0u | -0.15 ✗ noise |

| z ≥ +1 (very positive) | 0 | — | — | — | — | — |

#### `dSumRankNorm` (QUALITY_RANK)

r(WIN) = **-0.062** ✗ · r(ROI) = **-0.069** ✗ · Spearman ρ(ROI) = **-0.072**.

| Bucket | N | W-L-P | WR % [95% Wilson] | Flat ROI | Peak PnL | Flat t-stat |

#### `dWinnerCtPreA` (QUALITY_TRACK)

#### §AGS-3 recap — features sorted by univariate predictive power (|Spearman ρ vs. ROI|)

| Rank | Feature | Family | r(WIN) | r(ROI) | Spearman ρ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dSumRankNorm` | QUALITY_RANK | -0.062 ✗ | -0.069 ✗ | -0.072 |
| 2 | `dCount` | COUNT | -0.021 ✗ | -0.048 ✗ | -0.050 |
| 3 | `dHcSizeRatio` | INTENSITY_HC | NaN — | NaN — | NaN |
| 4 | `dWinnerCtPreA` | QUALITY_TRACK | NaN — | NaN — | NaN |

### §AGS-4. Per-feature contribution to the AGS score itself

A feature with mean |z| ≈ 0 contributes almost nothing to AGS in practice — even if it correlates with outcome, the calibration normalizes it down to silence. This is the "is the input even moving the dial" check. **Share of |AGS|** = mean |z| ÷ Σ mean |z|, the average percentage of the absolute AGS magnitude this feature accounts for.

| Rank | Feature | Mean signed z | Mean &#124;z&#124; | Share of &#124;AGS&#124; | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dCount` | -0.039 | 0.814 | 49.1% | dominant |
| 2 | `dSumRankNorm` | -0.105 | 0.798 | 48.2% | meaningful |
| 3 | `dWinnerCtPreA` | -0.031 | 0.031 | 1.9% | silent (<0.2) |
| 4 | `dHcSizeRatio` | -0.013 | 0.013 | 0.8% | silent (<0.2) |

### §AGS-5. Pairwise feature correlation (Pearson r between z-scored features)

Two features with |r| ≥ 0.7 are double-counting. Two with |r| ≤ 0.2 are orthogonal — keeping both adds genuine information. The composite design assumes mostly orthogonal inputs; this matrix is the audit.

| | `dCount` | `dHcSizeRatio` | `dSumRankNorm` | `dWinnerCtPreA` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dCount` | 1.000 | +0.039 | +0.727 ⚠ | +0.039 |
| `dHcSizeRatio` | +0.039 | 1.000 | +0.013 | +1.000 ⚠ |
| `dSumRankNorm` | +0.727 ⚠ | +0.013 | 1.000 | +0.013 |
| `dWinnerCtPreA` | +0.039 | +1.000 ⚠ | +0.013 | 1.000 |

_⚠ flags |r| ≥ 0.7 — those pairs are essentially the same signal._

### §AGS-6. Drop-one ablation — what happens if we remove each feature?

For each of the 6 inputs, recompute AGS as the **sum of the OTHER 5 z-scores** (each contribution preserved with its original sign), then evaluate three lenses. **The discriminative-power lens (Spearman ρ vs. outcome) is the cleanest** — a big drop in |ρ| means that feature carried marginal info the other five lacked. The cohort-matched lens compares apples-to-apples by holding cohort size fixed at the baseline lock-floor N. The same-threshold lens is included for transparency but read it with the caveat that removing a feature mechanically shrinks the cohort, so the surviving subset can look stronger purely from sample selection.

**Baseline (full 6-feature AGS):** Spearman ρ(AGS, flat ROI) = **-0.017**. At AGS ≥ +0.12 fires N=260, WR=50.8%, ROI=-4.9%. At AGS ≥ +null fires N=342, WR=51.6%, ROI=-3.5%.

| Feature dropped | ρ(5-feat AGS, ROI) | ρ drop vs full | Top-260 ROI (matched cohort) | Top-260 lift loss vs baseline | Same-threshold ≥+5 cell |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dCount` | +0.073 | +0.056 | WR=56%, ROI=+6.6% | -11.5pp | N=277, WR=55%, ROI=+6.1% |
| `dHcSizeRatio` | +0.040 | +0.023 | WR=54%, ROI=+0.7% | -5.7pp | N=268, WR=54%, ROI=+2.1% |
| `dSumRankNorm` | -0.054 | +0.037 | WR=47%, ROI=-10.3% | +5.4pp | N=258, WR=48%, ROI=-9.6% |
| `dWinnerCtPreA` | +0.042 | +0.025 | WR=54%, ROI=+1.5% | -6.4pp | N=257, WR=54%, ROI=+1.2% |

_Reading the **ρ drop** column: positive (`−0.0XX`) = dropping this feature **reduced** the AGS's ability to rank-order picks → the feature was carrying marginal info. Reading the **matched-cohort lift loss**: positive `+X pp` = the top-K of the 5-feature AGS earned LESS ROI than baseline → the feature was contributing positive lift._

#### §AGS-6 recap — features ranked by marginal info (Spearman ρ drop)

| Rank | Feature | ρ drop when removed | Matched-cohort lift loss | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dHcSizeRatio` | +0.023 | -5.7pp | redundant — other features cover it |
| 2 | `dWinnerCtPreA` | +0.025 | -6.4pp | redundant — other features cover it |
| 3 | `dSumRankNorm` | +0.037 | +5.4pp | redundant — other features cover it |
| 4 | `dCount` | +0.056 | -11.5pp | redundant — other features cover it |

### §AGS-7. Multivariate logistic regression on the 6 z-scored features

Fit `logit(P(WIN)) = α + Σ βᵢ · zᵢ` on the AGS sample. Standardized inputs ⇒ |β| is a fair cross-feature importance signal. AGS itself uses **equal sign-weighted** sums (β=+1 for every feature); a fitted β much larger or smaller than 1 indicates the equal-weight assumption may be off for that input.

| Rank | Feature | Family | β (z-input) | |β| | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dSumRankNorm` | QUALITY_RANK | -0.138 | 0.138 | negative ↓ |
| 2 | `dWinnerCtPreA` | QUALITY_TRACK | +0.035 | 0.035 | flat ≈ 0 |
| 3 | `dCount` | COUNT | +0.031 | 0.031 | flat ≈ 0 |
| 4 | `dHcSizeRatio` | INTENSITY_HC | +0.014 | 0.014 | flat ≈ 0 |

Intercept b = -0.005 · Final log-loss = 0.6903 · N = 562.

### §AGS-8. Final ranked verdict — composite importance across all four lenses

Each feature gets a 1..6 rank in each lens (1 = most important). The **composite rank** is the average — lower is better. A feature that ranks low across all four lenses is a clear candidate to drop or down-weight; a feature that ranks high across all four is the engine's real workhorse.

| Composite rank | Feature | Family | Univariate (§AGS-3) | Score-mover (§AGS-4) | Drop-one (§AGS-6) | Logistic (§AGS-7) | Avg rank |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dSumRankNorm` | QUALITY_RANK | #1 | #2 | #3 | #1 | 1.75 |
| 2 | `dCount` | COUNT | #2 | #1 | #4 | #3 | 2.50 |
| 3 | `dWinnerCtPreA` | QUALITY_TRACK | #4 | #3 | #2 | #2 | 2.75 |
| 4 | `dHcSizeRatio` | INTENSITY_HC | #3 | #4 | #1 | #4 | 3.00 |

#### Plain-English summary

- **Workhorse**: `dSumRankNorm` (QUALITY_RANK) — ranks #1/#2/#3/#1 across the four lenses. Whatever else changes, this one stays.
- **Weakest contributor**: `dHcSizeRatio` (INTENSITY_HC) — composite avg rank 3.00. Strong candidate to down-weight or drop in v9.
- **Redundant pairs (|r| ≥ 0.7)**: `dCount` ↔ `dSumRankNorm` (r=+0.73); `dHcSizeRatio` ↔ `dWinnerCtPreA` (r=+1.00). Each pair effectively double-counts the same signal in the composite.
- **Silent inputs (mean |z| < 0.2)**: `dWinnerCtPreA`, `dHcSizeRatio`. These barely move the AGS score in practice — calibration is washing them out.
- **In-sample calibration source**: `cron` (used as cold-start fallback for the first 34 of 562 PIT rows where prior history was thin). Live calibration is loaded; the means/SDs above are this morning's.
- **Look-ahead controls**: PIT proven gate (strict-prior-events tier lens) + walk-forward feature calibration (mean/SD per feature recomputed at each pick date from prior picks only, 34/562 cold-started). Production thresholds (+5/+3/-1) were tuned on overlapping data and are still treated as fixed constants here — the §AGS-0a leakage audit shows the true lift those thresholds deliver out-of-sample.

## §12. Per-cohort sizing recommendation
_Bayesian posterior WR (Beta(5,5) prior) and half-Kelly stake at the cohort's median odds. Compares to current ladder._

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tier-1a HC ≥ +2 (post-cutover) | 41 | 19-22 | 46.3% | 47.1% | -110 | — (mute) | 2.96u | **MUTE** (negative EV at posterior) |
| Tier-1b HC = +1 (post-cutover) | 152 | 84-68 | 55.3% | 54.9% | -110 | 2.69% bankroll | 2.12u | ~ in range — 2.69u |
| Tier-2 HC ≤ 0 ∧ Δw ≥ +2 (HC era) | 79 | 33-45 | 42.3% | 43.2% | -110 | — (mute) | 2.04u | **MUTE** (negative EV at posterior) |
| Δw ≥ +3 (full sample) | 102 | 49-53 | 48.0% | 48.2% | -109 | — (mute) | 2.46u | **MUTE** (negative EV at posterior) |
| Stale Δw = 0 | 121 | 61-57 | 51.7% | 51.6% | -110 | — (mute) | 1.79u | **MUTE** (negative EV at posterior) |
| Stale Δw ≤ −1 | 27 | 8-18 | 30.8% | 36.1% | -122 | — (mute) | 1.26u | **MUTE** (negative EV at posterior) |

> Bayesian posterior uses Beta(5,5) prior — pulls small-sample WR toward 50%. Half-Kelly is conservative; reduce by another 50% if you prefer quarter-Kelly. **Treat 1u = 1% of bankroll** when reading suggested stakes.
