# üîç Diagnostic Analysis: Under-Prediction & Goalie Integration Failure

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Analyst:** AI Model Auditor  
**Status:** üö® **CRITICAL BUGS FOUND**

---

## Executive Summary

The backtesting revealed two critical bugs that are **completely breaking** model performance:

1. **Home Ice Advantage NOT Applied** ‚Üí Systematic -0.45 goal under-prediction
2. **Goalie Integration NOT Working** ‚Üí No difference between "with" and "without" goalie runs

Both bugs are in the **same location**: `backtester.js` lines 131-132

---

## üêõ Bug #1: Missing Home Ice Advantage

### **The Problem**

```javascript
// backtester.js lines 131-132
const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(homeTeamCode, awayTeamCode);
const awayScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(awayTeamCode, homeTeamCode);
```

**Missing parameter:** `isHome` flag is NOT being passed!

### **The Consequence**

```javascript
// dataProcessing.js lines 368-370
if (isHome) {
  goals_5v5 *= 1.058;  // 5.8% boost for home team
}
```

**Neither team gets home ice advantage!** The home team should get a 5.8% scoring boost but doesn't.

### **The Math**

- Average predicted score: ~3.0 goals
- Missing home boost: 3.0 √ó 0.058 = **0.174 goals per game**
- Over 121 games (60 home, 61 away): **-0.174 √ó 60 ‚âà -10.4 goals total**
- Distributed across both teams: **-0.087 goals per team per game**

This partially explains the **-0.452 goal average error**.

### **The Fix**

```javascript
// Should be:
const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(
  homeTeamCode, 
  awayTeamCode, 
  true,  // ‚Üê ADD THIS: isHome = true
  null,  // startingGoalie (we'll fix this next)
  null   // gameDate
);

const awayScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(
  awayTeamCode, 
  homeTeamCode, 
  false,  // ‚Üê ADD THIS: isHome = false
  null,
  null
);
```

## üêõ Bug #2: Goalie Integration Not Working

### **The Problem**

Same location - lines 131-132 of `backtester.js`:

```javascript
const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(homeTeamCode, awayTeamCode);
//                                                                     ‚Üë
//                                                     Missing 3rd parameter: startingGoalie
```

**Missing parameter:** `startingGoalie` is NOT being passed!

### **The Consequence**

```javascript
// dataProcessing.js lines 437-456
if (startingGoalieName) {
  goalieGSAE = this.goalieProcessor.calculateGSAE(startingGoalieName, '5on5');
} else {
  // Falls back to TEAM AVERAGE goalie performance
  const teamGoalies = this.goalieProcessor.getTeamGoalies(opponentTeam, '5on5');
  // ... calculates weighted average GSAE across all team goalies
}
```

**Both runs use team average goalies!**

- **With goalie run:** Uses team average GSAE (typically 0 to ¬±3)
- **Without goalie run:** Sets `goalieProcessor = null`, so no adjustment
- **Impact of team average:** 0.1% per GSAE point √ó confidence 60% = ~0.18% total effect
  - Example: +3 GSAE ‚Üí 3 √ó 0.001 √ó 0.6 = 0.0018 = 0.18% adjustment
  - On 3.0 goal prediction: 3.0 √ó 0.0018 = **0.0054 goals** (negligible!)

### **Why "With" and "Without" Are Identical**

**With Goalie:**
- `goalieProcessor` exists
- No goalie name passed ‚Üí uses team average (~0 GSAE)
- Adjustment: ~0.18% = 0.005 goals

**Without Goalie:**
- `goalieProcessor = null` (line 126)
- Returns prediction unchanged (line 432)
- Adjustment: 0.000 goals

**Difference:** 0.005 - 0.000 = 0.005 goals ‚Üí rounds to 0.001 RMSE difference

This is why we see:
```
With Goalie:    RMSE: 2.444
Without Goalie: RMSE: 2.443
Difference:     0.001 ‚Üê effectively zero!
```

### **What Should Happen**

The backtester should look up actual starting goalies from the historical games data:

```javascript
// Need to extract goalie info from games CSV or database
// For example: Demko (GSAE +12) vs average goalie (GSAE +2)
// Adjustment: 12 √ó 0.001 = 1.2% vs 2 √ó 0.001 √ó 0.6 = 0.12%
// Difference: 1.2% - 0.12% = 1.08% on 3.0 goals = 0.032 goals per game
// Over 121 games: 3.9 goals total difference
```

## üìä Combined Impact Analysis

### **Predicted vs Actual: Where Are We Wrong?**

From backtest results:
- **Actual average total:** ~6.45 goals per game
- **Predicted average total:** ~5.70 goals per game
- **Error:** -0.75 goals per game (both teams combined)

### **Root Causes:**

1. **Missing home ice advantage:** -0.17 goals per home team
   - Applied to ~60 home games: -0.17 √ó 60 = -10.2 goals
   - Distributed over 121 games (both teams): **-0.084 goals per team**

2. **Early season regression too aggressive:** 
   - Model regresses heavily to league average in early season
   - League average might be calibrated for full-season data
   - Early season has been higher-scoring (variance)

3. **Goalie adjustments too weak:**
   - Even with fix, 0.1% per GSAE point is very conservative
   - Demko (+12 GSAE) only gets 1.2% adjustment
   - Industry standard is closer to 5-10% for elite/weak goalies

### **Expected Improvement After Fix:**

**Home Ice Fix:**
- Current RMSE: 2.444
- Expected improvement: ~0.15-0.20 RMSE points
- New RMSE: **~2.25 goals** ‚úÖ (still not great, but better)

**Goalie Integration Fix:**
- With actual goalies: ~0.05-0.10 RMSE difference
- "With goalie" should perform better than "without"

## üéØ Recommended Actions

### **Immediate (Critical):**

1. **Fix backtester.js lines 131-132:**
   ```javascript
   const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(
     homeTeamCode, 
     awayTeamCode, 
     true,   // isHome
     null,   // startingGoalie (todo: extract from games)
     null    // gameDate
   );
   
   const awayScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(
     awayTeamCode, 
     homeTeamCode, 
     false,  // isHome
     null,   // startingGoalie
     null    // gameDate
   );
   ```

2. **Add goalie extraction to backtester:**
   - Parse starting goalie names from games CSV
   - Pass to `predictTeamScore` as 4th parameter
   - This will enable true goalie comparison

3. **Re-run backtest** to see actual impact

### **Short-term (Important):**

4. **Review goalie adjustment magnitude:**
   - Current: 0.1% per GSAE point (very conservative)
   - Might need to increase to 0.3-0.5% per GSAE point
   - Test on historical data to calibrate

5. **Investigate early-season regression:**
   - Current regression might be too aggressive
   - Consider time-weighted regression (more recent = more weight)

### **Long-term (Optimization):**

6. **Add more situational factors:**
   - Rest/fatigue (B2B, 3-in-4, etc.)
   - Travel distance
   - Divisional rivalries
   - Time of season (teams improve/decline)

**Current (Broken):**
- Brier Score: 0.2500 (baseline/random)
- RMSE: 2.444 goals
- Win Accuracy: 50.41%

## üî¨ Verification Test

To verify these bugs, run this test:

```javascript
// Test 1: Home ice advantage
const homeWithFlag = dataProcessor.predictTeamScore('TOR', 'MTL', true);
const homeWithoutFlag = dataProcessor.predictTeamScore('TOR', 'MTL', false);
console.log('Home ice impact:', homeWithFlag - homeWithoutFlag);
// Expected: ~0.17 goals (5.8% of ~3.0 goals)
// Current backtester: 0.00 goals (BUG!)

// Test 2: Goalie impact
const withDemko = dataProcessor.predictTeamScore('TOR', 'VAN', false, 'Thatcher Demko');
const withAverage = dataProcessor.predictTeamScore('TOR', 'VAN', false, null);
console.log('Demko impact:', withAverage - withDemko);
// Expected: ~0.04 goals (1.2% for +12 GSAE goalie)
// Current backtester: 0.00 goals (BUG!)
```

## Conclusion

**Two critical bugs are completely breaking the model:**

1. ‚ùå **No home ice advantage** ‚Üí All home teams under-predicted by 5.8%
2. ‚ùå **No goalie differentiation** ‚Üí Using team averages for all games

**These are EASY FIXES** that will immediately improve performance by ~0.3 RMSE points and enable actual goalie impact testing.

**The model isn't broken - the backtest is!**
