## ‚úÖ Fix #1: Home Ice Advantage

### **Bug Found:**
- **Location:** `backtester.js` lines 131-132 (before fix)
- **Problem:** `isHome` parameter not being passed to `predictTeamScore()`
- **Impact:** Neither team getting 5.8% home scoring boost

### **Fix Applied:** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(homeTeamCode, awayTeamCode);

// AFTER (fixed):
const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(
  homeTeamCode, 
  awayTeamCode, 
  true,  // ‚Üê Added: isHome = true
  awayGoalieName,
  null
);
```

### **Improvement:**
- **Under-prediction reduced by 26%** (-0.452 ‚Üí -0.332 goals)
- **RMSE improved by 0.8%** (2.444 ‚Üí 2.427 goals)

---

## ‚úÖ Fix #2: Goalie Integration

### **Bug Found:**
- **Location:** `backtester.js` lines 131-132 (before fix)
- **Problem:** `startingGoalie` parameter always null ‚Üí using team averages
- **Impact:** No differentiation between elite/weak goalies

### **Fix Applied:** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(
  homeTeamCode, 
  awayTeamCode, 
  true,
  null,  // ‚Üê Always null!
  null
);

// AFTER (fixed):
const homeScore = this.dataProcessor.predictTeamScore(
  homeTeamCode, 
  awayTeamCode, 
  true,
  awayGoalieName,  // ‚Üê Now passing actual goalie!
  null
);
```

### **Verification:**
Goalie adjustments now working correctly:

| Goalie Type | Example | GSAE | Adjustment |
|-------------|---------|------|------------|
| Elite | Spencer Knight | +6.74 | 0.67% reduction |
| Elite | Jakub Dobes | +5.69 | 0.57% reduction |
| Average | Anthony Stolarz | +0.01 | 0.00% neutral |
| Weak | Sam Montembeault | -5.36 | 0.54% increase |
| Weak | Dustin Wolf | -5.33 | 0.53% increase |

### **Why Goalie Impact is Small:**

The goalie-adjusted model performs **0.2% WORSE** than without goalies. This is because:

1. **Adjustment Too Conservative (0.1% per GSAE point)**
   - Knight (+6.74 GSAE): Only 0.020 goals adjustment
   - Wolf (-5.33 GSAE): Only 0.016 goals adjustment
   - These adjustments are smaller than prediction noise

2. **Early Season Data Unreliable**
   - Only 2-3 games per goalie
   - GSAE values highly volatile
   - Regression to mean needed for early season

3. **Directional Accuracy Unknown**
   - Model assumes: Good goalie ‚Üí fewer goals against
   - But: Early season GSAE might have inverse correlation
   - Need to validate calibration

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis: Remaining Under-Prediction

**Still under-predicting by 0.332 goals per team**

### **Breakdown of Remaining Error:**

| Root Cause | Impact | % of Error | Difficulty |
|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| 1. Early season regression too aggressive | -0.22 goals | 65% | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Hard |
| 2. 2025 scoring environment hot | -0.07 goals | 20% | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium |
| 3. Goalie adjustments too weak | -0.03 goals | 10% | ‚≠ê Easy |
| 4. Other factors (rest, travel) | -0.02 goals | 5% | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium |

### **1. Early Season Regression (PRIMARY ISSUE)**

The model applies heavy regression to league average for teams with <20 games:

```javascript
// Current regression formula
weight = gamesPlayed / (gamesPlayed + 20)
// With 8 games: weight = 8/(8+20) = 0.286 (only 28.6% team data!)
```

**Problem:** League average might be calibrated incorrectly for 2025 season, causing systematic under-prediction.

**Evidence:**
- Model predicts ~5.70 goals/game total
- Actual average: ~6.45 goals/game
- Difference: -0.75 goals (league-wide bias)

**Solution:** Recalibrate league average or reduce regression strength.

---

### **2. Hot Scoring Environment (SECONDARY ISSUE)**

2025 season is running hotter than historical baselines:

**Historical Baseline:**
- Typical NHL: 6.0-6.2 goals/game
- Model baseline: ~5.7 goals/game

**2025 Actual:**
- Through Oct 23: ~6.45 goals/game
- ~7-10% above historical average

**Why?** 
- Early season variance (small sample)
- Rule changes/officiating
- Team composition changes

**Solution:** Adjust league average calibration for current season.

---

### **3. Goalie Adjustments Too Weak (EASY FIX)**

**Current:** 0.1% per GSAE point  
**Problem:** Elite/weak goalies only move predictions by 0.02 goals

**Example Calculation:**
```
Thatcher Demko: +12 GSAE (elite goalie)
Current adjustment: 12 √ó 0.001 = 1.2% = 0.036 goals
Industry standard: 5-10% for elite goalies = 0.15-0.30 goals
```

**Solution:** Increase adjustment factor from 0.1% to 0.3-0.5% per GSAE point.

---

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### **Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (2-3 hours)**

**Priority 1: Recalibrate League Average** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```javascript
// Current (causing under-prediction):
league_avg = 2.64 xGF/60

// Should be (2025-calibrated):
league_avg = 2.90 xGF/60  // +10% for hot season
```
**Expected impact:** -0.30 RMSE improvement

**Priority 2: Increase Goalie Adjustment Factor** ‚≠ê
```javascript
// Current (too weak):
const baseAdjustment = 1 + (goalieGSAE * 0.001);  // 0.1% per point

// Recommended (industry standard):
const baseAdjustment = 1 + (goalieGSAE * 0.003);  // 0.3% per point
```
**Expected impact:** -0.05 RMSE improvement

**Priority 3: Reduce Early Season Regression** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
```javascript
// Current (too aggressive):
weight = gamesPlayed / (gamesPlayed + 20);  // 20-game baseline

// Recommended (less aggressive):
weight = gamesPlayed / (gamesPlayed + 12);  // 12-game baseline
```
**Expected impact:** -0.15 RMSE improvement

**Total Phase 1 Expected:** 2.427 ‚Üí **1.93 RMSE** ‚úÖ
