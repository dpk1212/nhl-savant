# Perplexity Prompt Improvements - November 10, 2025

## 🎯 Goal
Strengthen anti-hallucination rules and humanize the content generated by Perplexity AI for matchup insights.

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Matchup Insight Cards (Hot Takes)** - `generateAnalysis()`

#### Anti-Hallucination Improvements:
- ✅ Changed from "STRICTLY ENFORCE" to **"ZERO TOLERANCE"** with emoji warnings (🚨🚨🚨)
- ✅ Added explicit **FORBIDDEN list** with ❌ symbols for visibility:
  - Never cite specific player stats unless verifiable RIGHT NOW
  - Never invent team records, win/loss streaks, or recent game scores
  - Never make up injuries, line changes, or roster moves
  - Never fabricate "according to" statements or fake citations
  - Never invent shooting percentages, save percentages, or statistical data
  - Never create fake recent game narratives
- ✅ Added **"WHAT TO DO INSTEAD"** section with ✅ symbols showing alternatives:
  - Focus on general team trends you can verify
  - Discuss matchup dynamics without specific numbers
  - Use conditional language ("tends to", "has been")
  - When in doubt, be more general
- ✅ Added explicit instruction: **"IF YOU CANNOT VERIFY A STAT OR FACT, DO NOT INCLUDE IT. WRITE AROUND IT."**
- ✅ Strengthened examples with "BAD HOOKS" section showing what NOT to do

#### Humanization Improvements:
- ✅ Added **"WRITING STYLE - HUMANIZE THE CONTENT"** section at the top
- ✅ Explicit instructions to write like "a knowledgeable hockey fan texting a friend, NOT a corporate analyst"
- ✅ Encouraged conversational language: "look", "here's the thing", "honestly"
- ✅ Encouraged contractions (don't, it's, there's)
- ✅ Told to avoid buzzwords and corporate-speak
- ✅ Updated examples to sound more human:
  - ✅ GOOD: "Look, the betting public is way off on Toronto's road game..."
  - ❌ BAD: "Statistical analysis indicates favorable positioning..." (robotic)
  - ❌ BAD: "Both teams are trending upward based on recent performance metrics" (corporate nonsense)
- ✅ Updated system prompt to emphasize: **"WRITE LIKE A HUMAN, not a robot"**

  - Mentioning percentages, probabilities, EV figures
  - Adding player names, team records, injuries, recent game results
  - ANY data not explicitly in the provided factors list
- ✅ Added: **"If it's not in the factors, don't write it"**

#### Humanization Improvements:
- ✅ Added **"WRITING STYLE - SOUND HUMAN"** section
- ✅ Instruction to write like "explaining value to a sharp bettor friend, NOT writing a research report"
- ✅ Encouraged casual language: "look", "here's the thing", "honestly"

- ✅ Updated system prompt: **"WRITE LIKE A HUMAN - use contractions, casual phrases, varied sentence structure"**

#### Humanization Improvements:
- ✅ Added **"WRITING STYLE - HUMANIZE THE CONTENT"** section

- ✅ Encouraged conversational phrases: "look", "here's the thing", "honestly", "the market's missing"
- ✅ Emphasized: "Be confident and opinionated, but sound natural"
- ✅ Tone guidance: "Confident sharp bettor talking to another sharp, NOT a textbook"

## 🎯 Expected Impact

### Anti-Hallucination:
1. **Reduced false claims** - AI will avoid inventing stats it can't verify
2. **Better source grounding** - Will stick to verifiable, general matchup analysis
3. **No fake data** - Won't fabricate player stats, team records, or recent game results
4. **Safer content** - Less risk of publishing inaccurate information

### Humanization:
1. **More engaging** - Content sounds like it's written by a human, not a bot
2. **Better readability** - Varied sentence structure, contractions, casual phrases
3. **More shareable** - Natural, conversational tone is more likely to be shared
4. **Brand authenticity** - Sounds like expert analysis, not generic AI output

## 📊 Testing Recommendation

After deploying these changes:
1. **Monitor next day's generated content** (GitHub Action runs at 9 AM ET)
2. **Check for hallucinations** - Review if any stats/claims seem fabricated
3. **Assess tone** - Does it sound human or still robotic?
4. **User feedback** - Do users engage more with the new style?
