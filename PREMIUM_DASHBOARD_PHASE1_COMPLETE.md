## New Components

### 1. Observatory.jsx
**The Hero Section - Team Constellation Visualization**

**Features:**
- Interactive 32-team constellation positioned by xG metrics
- X-axis: Offensive xG/60 (team scoring ability)
- Y-axis: Defensive xG/60 (inverted - lower is better)
- Orb size: PDO value (luck factor, 100 = average)
- Color coding:
  - Green (#10B981): Hot teams (PDO > 102)
  - Blue (#3B82F6): Neutral teams (PDO 98-102)
  - Red (#EF4444): Cold teams (PDO < 98)
- Glow intensity based on PDO deviation
- Hover tooltips with detailed stats
- Smooth framer-motion animations
- Starry background with twinkling effect

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Shows top 16 teams (by PDO deviation)
- Reduced canvas height (400px vs 600px)
- Larger touch targets
- Simplified animations

**Data Displayed:**
- Team code (e.g., "TOR", "BOS")
- xGF/60 (offensive expected goals)
- xGA/60 (defensive expected goals)
- xGD/60 (goal differential)
- PDO (luck metric)
- Games played

### 2. PremiumStatsGrid.jsx
**Glassmorphic Analytics Cards**

**Features:**
- 8 premium metric cards
- Animated counters (count up on load)
- Frosted glass effect (backdrop-filter: blur)
- Glow on hover
- Live status indicators
- Pulse animation for active data
- 4x2 grid (desktop) / 2x4 (mobile)

**Metrics:**
1. Teams Analyzed (32)
2. Games This Week (12)
3. Model Accuracy (58.2%)
4. Current ROI (4.2%)
5. Active +EV Bets (10)
6. Elite Opportunities (9)
7. Confirmed Goalies (24)
8. PDO Regression Candidates (varies)

**Status Badges:**
- Live (with pulse animation)
- Active
- Strong
- Elite
