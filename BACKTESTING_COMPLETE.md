## üìä Backtest Results Summary

### Overall Performance: ‚ùå FAIL

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Brier Score** | < 0.23 | 0.2486 | ‚ö†Ô∏è MARGINAL |
| **RMSE** | < 1.8 | 2.465 | ‚ùå FAIL |
| **vs Baseline** | +10% | -6.2% | ‚ùå FAIL |
| **Win Accuracy** | >58% | 56.25% | ‚ö†Ô∏è MARGINAL |

### Critical Findings:

1. **Model Under-Predicts by 0.82 goals per game**
   - Predicting ~5.25 goals, actual is ~6.07 goals
   - Severe under-prediction on high-scoring games (8+ goals)

2. **Worse Than Baseline**
   - Simple "6.0 goals every game" has RMSE of 2.322
   - Our model has RMSE of 2.465
   - Model is **6.2% worse** than random

3. **Win Probability Clustering**
   - All predictions clustered 50-55%
   - No meaningful confidence variation
   - Barely better than coin flip

4. **Goalie Integration Ineffective**
   - WITH goalie: RMSE 2.465
   - WITHOUT goalie: RMSE 2.377
   - Goalie makes model 3.69% WORSE

5. **Predictions Too "Flat"**
   - All teams predicting ~5.25 goals regardless of strength
   - Model not capturing team differences
   - Over-regression to mean

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Base Scoring Rate Too Low

**Problem:** Model predicts 5.25 goals, actual is 6.07 goals

**Root Cause:** One or more of:
- Score-adjusted xG over-dampening
- Wrong constants in `predictTeamScore()`
- Regression to mean too aggressive
- Home ice advantage too small

**Fix Required:** Increase base scoring by ~15-20%

---

### Issue #2: Zero Team Differentiation

**Problem:** All teams cluster around same prediction (~5.25)

**Root Cause:** Model is "flattening" team differences

**Evidence:**
| Game Type | Expected | Actual |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| BOS vs ANA | 6.5 vs 5.0 | ~5.25 |
| MTL vs CHI | 5.5 vs 5.5 | ~5.25 |
| TBL vs CGY | 6.0 vs 5.5 | ~5.25 |

**Fix Required:** Reduce regression, increase team strength impact

---

### Issue #3: Win Probability Broken

**Problem:** All win probabilities 50-55%, no variation

**Root Cause:** Likely one of:
- k parameter too large (over-smoothing)
- Home ice advantage not applied
- Team strength differences too small
- Using wrong formula

**Fix Required:** Debug `estimateWinProbability()` function

---

### Issue #4: Goalie Implementation Broken

**Problem:** Adding goalie makes model WORSE

**Root Cause:** Either:
- GSAE calculation incorrect
- Team-average stats meaningless
- Adjustment applied with wrong sign
- Weight too large/small

**Fix Required:** Debug or disable goalie integration

---

## üîß Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### **Priority 1: Increase Base Scoring Rate**

**Files:** `src/utils/dataProcessing.js`

**Investigation:**
1. Add console.log to `predictTeamScore()` for typical game
2. Check offensive/defensive scores
3. Verify constants (minutes, rates, etc.)
4. Compare to 2024 actual average (6.07 goals)

**Target:** Predictions average 6.0-6.1 goals

---

### **Priority 2: Fix Team Differentiation**

**Files:** `src/utils/dataProcessing.js`

**Investigation:**
1. Check if team data loading correctly
2. Verify offensive/defensive ratings have variance
3. Reduce score adjustment impact
4. Reduce PDO regression

**Target:** Top teams 6.5+, bottom teams 5.0-5.5

---

### **Priority 3: Fix Win Probability**

**Files:** `src/utils/dataProcessing.js`

**Investigation:**
1. Check `estimateWinProbability()` output
2. Verify k parameter value
3. Confirm home ice advantage applied
4. Test with actual predicted scores

**Target:** Calibration curve 40-70% range

---

### **Priority 4: Debug Goalie**

**Files:** `src/utils/goalieProcessor.js`, `src/utils/dataProcessing.js`

**Investigation:**
1. Log `getTeamAverageGoalieStats()` output
2. Verify GSAE values reasonable
3. Check adjustment magnitude
4. Confirm not reversed

**Target:** With goalie 2-5% better than without

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. **Backtesting Prevents Disaster**

Without this backtest, we would have bet real money on a model that's:
- Worse than random guessing
- Under-predicting by 0.82 goals per game
- Barely better than coin flip for win probability

**This backtest saved us from guaranteed losses.**

### 2. **Model Has Fundamental Issues**

The problems aren't minor tuning issues:
- Base predictions too low
- Team differentiation missing
- Win probability broken
- Goalie integration ineffective

**Requires significant rework, not just tweaking.**

### 3. **We Have the Tools to Fix It**

- Fast iteration (2 min per test)
- Clear diagnostics
- Complete historical data
- Comprehensive metrics

**Can iterate quickly to working model.**

### 4. **2024 Data is Different Than Expected**

Model was likely tuned on different data:
- 2024 actual average: 6.07 goals
- Model assumes: ~5.25 goals
- Need to recalibrate to 2024 reality

## üìä Backtest vs. Production

### What Backtest Tests:
‚úÖ Prediction accuracy on past data  
‚úÖ Calibration quality  
‚úÖ Model consistency  
‚úÖ Relative performance  

### What Backtest CANNOT Test:
‚ùå Betting profitability (no odds data)  
‚ùå Line value (no closing lines)  
‚ùå Real-world execution  
‚ùå Market efficiency  

### Still Need:
- Paper trading on current season
- Comparison to market odds
- Validation that edge persists
- Proof of profitability
