WRITING GUIDANCE:
- Lead with the most dramatic matchup mismatch (shot zone exploits, elite vs weak)
- Use specific numbers: "shoots 60.4% at the rim (#124 in D1)" > "good at scoring inside"
- Frame as offense vs defense: "GW's elite 3PT shooting meets VCU's top-30 rim protection"
- Include D1 context: "5 points above D1 average" tells the reader HOW good, not just good
- Mention home/away — it matters for narrative and the 3-4 point swing
