# MONEYLINE Factors - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
The MONEYLINE factors implementation was calling non-existent methods on `AdvancedStatsAnalyzer`, causing runtime errors that broke:
- Premium insights rendering
- Deep Analytics section
- All factor-based features

### Error Message
```
TypeError: this.analyzer.getTeamStats is not a function
    at calculateExpectedGoalsDifferential
```

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: `calculateExpectedGoalsDifferential()` 
**Problem:** Called `this.analyzer.getTeamStats()` which doesn't exist

**Solution:** Use `this.analyzer.dataProcessor.getTeamData(teamCode, '5on5')` to access raw team data, then calculate per-60 rates manually.

### Issue 2: `calculateGoalieAdvantage()`
**Problem:** Called `this.analyzer.getGoalieStats()` which doesn't exist

**Solution:** Disabled this factor entirely (returns `null`). Goalie advantage is already factored into predictions via `adjustForGoalie()` in the main prediction model, so this would have been redundant anyway.

## Fixes Implemented

### Fix 1: `calculateExpectedGoalsDifferential()` (lines 475-524)

**Before:**
```javascript
const awayStats = this.analyzer.getTeamStats(awayTeam); // ‚ùå DOESN'T EXIST
const homeStats = this.analyzer.getTeamStats(homeTeam);

const awayXgfPer60 = awayStats.xGoalsForPer60 || 0;
const awayXgaPer60 = awayStats.xGoalsAgainstPer60 || 0;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const awayStats = this.analyzer.dataProcessor.getTeamData(awayTeam, '5on5'); // ‚úÖ CORRECT
const homeStats = this.analyzer.dataProcessor.getTeamData(homeTeam, '5on5');

// Calculate per-60 rates from raw data
const awayIceTime = awayStats.iceTime / 60; // Convert seconds to minutes
const homeIceTime = homeStats.iceTime / 60;

const awayXgfPer60 = ((awayStats.xGoalsFor || 0) / awayIceTime) * 60;
const awayXgaPer60 = ((awayStats.xGoalsAgainst || 0) / awayIceTime) * 60;
const homeXgfPer60 = ((homeStats.xGoalsFor || 0) / homeIceTime) * 60;
const homeXgaPer60 = ((homeStats.xGoalsAgainst || 0) / homeIceTime) * 60;
```

**Key Changes:**
- Use `dataProcessor.getTeamData()` instead of non-existent `getTeamStats()`
- Manually calculate per-60 rates from raw `xGoalsFor`, `xGoalsAgainst`, and `iceTime`
- Fixed league rank call to use `'xGoalsFor'` instead of `'xGoalsForPer60'`

### Fix 2: `calculateGoalieAdvantage()` (lines 531-535)

**Before:**
```javascript
calculateGoalieAdvantage(awayTeam, homeTeam) {
  const awayGoalie = this.analyzer.getGoalieStats?.(awayTeam); // ‚ùå DOESN'T EXIST
  const homeGoalie = this.analyzer.getGoalieStats?.(homeTeam);
  
  if (!awayGoalie || !homeGoalie) return null;
  // ... 35 lines of code that never runs
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
calculateGoalieAdvantage(awayTeam, homeTeam) {
  // Goalie impact is already included in the prediction model
  // No need to duplicate it as a separate factor
  return null;
}
```

**Rationale:**
- `AdvancedStatsAnalyzer` has no method to retrieve goalie stats
- Goalie advantage is already factored into predictions via `adjustForGoalie()` in `dataProcessing.js`
- This factor would have been redundant even if it worked
- Clean solution: disable it entirely

## MONEYLINE Factors Now Available

After fixes, MONEYLINE bets will show **5 factors** (down from intended 6):

1. ‚úÖ **Expected Goals Differential** (CRITICAL ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) - FIXED
2. ‚ùå **Goalie Advantage** (CRITICAL ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê) - DISABLED (redundant)
3. ‚úÖ **Offensive Rating** (HIGH ‚≠ê‚≠ê) - Working
4. ‚úÖ **Defensive Rating** (HIGH ‚≠ê‚≠ê) - Working
5. ‚úÖ **Special Teams Edge** (MODERATE ‚≠ê) - Working
6. ‚úÖ **Possession & Control** (MODERATE ‚≠ê) - Working

**Total: 5 working factors** (goalie factor intentionally disabled)

## Files Modified

### `src/utils/edgeFactorCalculator.js`
- **Lines 475-524:** Fixed `calculateExpectedGoalsDifferential()` to use correct data access methods
- **Lines 531-535:** Disabled `calculateGoalieAdvantage()` to return null

### Build Artifacts
- `dist/assets/index-BT1qbJMw.js` - New production bundle
- `public/assets/index-BT1qbJMw.js` - Deployed

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
```
‚ùå Error: this.analyzer.getTeamStats is not a function
‚ùå No factors generated
‚ùå No insights displayed
‚ùå Deep Analytics section missing
```

### After Fix
```
‚úÖ No errors
‚úÖ 5 MONEYLINE factors generated
‚úÖ 2-3 insights displayed in premium box
‚úÖ Deep Analytics section renders
‚úÖ Alternative bet card shows insights
```

## Testing Results

### Console Output (Expected)
```
‚úÖ No errors in console
‚úÖ Factors returned: 5 factors (for MONEYLINE)
‚úÖ Generated insights: [
  "Expected Goals: DET has 18% edge",
  "Offensive Rating: DET has 15% edge",
  "Defensive Rating: DET has 12% edge"
]
```

### UI Output (Expected)
```
üí∞ BEST VALUE: DET (AWAY)

‚úì WHY THIS IS THE BEST VALUE:
‚Ä¢ Expected Goals: DET has 18% edge
‚Ä¢ Offensive Rating: DET has 15% edge
‚Ä¢ Defensive Rating: DET has 12% edge

[Probability bars, stats, etc.]

üéØ Deep Dive: Advanced Metrics

## Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ **Code fixed** - Both issues resolved
- ‚úÖ **Built successfully** - `index-BT1qbJMw.js` (4.09s)
- ‚úÖ **Copied to public/** - Ready for hosting
- ‚úÖ **Committed to git** - Commit `1e1e0a6`
- ‚è≥ **Ready to push** - Requires GitHub authentication

## Technical Notes

### Why Manual Per-60 Calculation?
The `dataProcessor.getTeamData()` returns raw cumulative stats, not per-60 rates. We need to:
1. Get raw `xGoalsFor` and `xGoalsAgainst`
2. Get `iceTime` (in seconds)
3. Convert to minutes: `iceTime / 60`
4. Calculate per-60: `(rawStat / iceTimeMinutes) * 60`

### Why Disable Goalie Factor?
1. No clean way to access goalie stats from `AdvancedStatsAnalyzer`
2. Goalie impact already in model via `adjustForGoalie()` in `dataProcessing.js`
3. Would be redundant/double-counting
4. Cleaner to disable than to hack around

### Data Flow
```
dataProcessor.getTeamData(teamCode, '5on5')
  ‚Üì
{
  team: 'DET',
  iceTime: 3456, // seconds
  xGoalsFor: 12.5,
  xGoalsAgainst: 10.8,
  highDangerxGoalsFor: 4.2,
  // ... 100+ other metrics
}
  ‚Üì
Calculate per-60 rates manually
  ‚Üì
Generate factor with impact, metrics, explanation
```
