## Key Findings

✅ **OPTIMAL FACTOR FOUND: 1.00x**

- RMSE improved by 0.000 goals (0.0%)
- Final RMSE: 2.396 goals
- ML accuracy protected: 62.0%

## ⚠️  RECOMMENDATION: CONTINUE IMPROVING

Best factor (1.00x) improves RMSE but doesn't meet target (< 2.0).
Current: 2.396, Target: < 2.0

May need additional adjustments beyond amplification.
