# ✅ B2B/Rest Adjustments - 2025-26 Season READY

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY FOR 2025-26 SEASON**

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED

**CORRECTED:** B2B system now uses **2025-26 season schedule** (`nhl-202526-asplayed.csv`)  
**NOT:** ~~2024-25 season (which was for backtesting)~~

---

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Before (WRONG):
- Loaded: `nhl-202425-asplayed.csv` (2024-25 season, Oct 2024-Apr 2025)
- Issue: Historical data, not current season
- Impact: B2B adjustments for **past games**, not current predictions

### After (CORRECT):
- Loads: `nhl-202526-asplayed.csv` (2025-26 season, Oct 2025+)
- Date format: MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., "10/7/2025")
- 32 teams properly mapped
- B2B adjustments for **current 2025-26 season games** ✅

## 🛠️ Implementation

### Schedule File
```
nhl-202526-asplayed.csv
├─ 1,312 games
├─ 32 teams
├─ Date range: Oct 2025 - Apr 2026
└─ Format: MM/DD/YYYY
```

### Team Name Mapping (2025-26)
```
"Chicago Blackhawks" → CHI
"Florida Panthers" → FLA
"New York Rangers" → NYR
"Utah Mammoth" → UTA  (2025-26 season team name)
... (32 teams total)
```

### Files Updated
```
✅ src/App.jsx
   - Fetch: /nhl-202526-asplayed.csv (was: nhl-202425)

✅ src/utils/scheduleHelper.js
   - Added: Team name mapping (32 teams)
   - Fixed: "Utah Mammoth" mapping to UTA

## 📊 How B2B Adjustments Work (2025-26)

```
Example: Boston Bruins (BOS) on B2B vs New York Rangers (NYR) with extra rest

1. Schedule loads 2025-26 games
2. For each prediction:
   - Check: "Did BOS play yesterday?"
   - If YES: -3% goals (tired)
   - If NO: 0% (normal)
   - If 3+ days: +4% (rested)

3. Apply to predictions:
   BOS (B2B): 2.85 × 0.97 = 2.76 goals
   NYR (rested): 2.95 × 1.04 = 3.07 goals
```
