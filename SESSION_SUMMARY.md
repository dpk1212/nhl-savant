# Session Summary - October 28, 2025

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Fixed Production-Breaking Error (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: Website was down with `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'N' before initialization`

**Cause**: `memoizedAllEdges` was used before it was defined in `TodaysGames.jsx`

**Fix**: Reverted the `useMemo` optimization that caused the error

**Status**: ‚úÖ **HOTFIX COMMITTED** - Site should be back up after deployment

**Important**: All duplicate-prevention fixes are still in place:
- ‚úÖ Deterministic bet IDs
- ‚úÖ Firebase transactions  
- ‚úÖ Sequential processing with locks

---

### 2. Completed 2025-26 Early Season Accuracy Test

**Sample**: 104 regulation games (Oct 7-27, 2025)

**Created Files**:
- `scripts/test2025Accuracy.js` - Full accuracy testing script
- `EARLY_SEASON_2025_ACCURACY.md` - Detailed results report
- `ACCURACY_TEST_ANALYSIS.md` - Strategic analysis and recommendations

#### Results Summary

**Total Goals Prediction**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Close to Target
- RMSE: 2.209 goals (Target: < 2.0)
- Average Error: -0.358 goals (under-predicting)
- Status: Slightly over target, but acceptable for betting

**Win Probability Prediction**: ‚ùå Critical Issue
- Brier Score: 0.2500 (Target: < 0.23)
- Win Accuracy: 44.2% (Target: > 55%)
- **Problem**: All predictions clustering at exactly 50.0%

## üéØ KEY FINDINGS

### Good News:
1. ‚úÖ Model is functional and predictions are working
2. ‚úÖ Team name mapping working correctly
3. ‚úÖ Goalie GSAE adjustments working
4. ‚úÖ Calibration constant 1.39 verified as approximately correct
5. ‚úÖ Median prediction error is nearly zero

### Issues Found:

#### Priority 1: Win Probability Function Broken (CRITICAL)
- All predictions are 50/50 coin flips
- Not useful for betting decisions
- Likely issues:
  - Home ice advantage not being applied
  - `k` parameter in `estimateWinProbability()` needs review
  - Score differences not translating to probability differences

#### Priority 2: Slight Under-Prediction Bias
- Model under-predicts by 0.358 goals per game
- Recommendation: Adjust calibration from 1.39 ‚Üí 1.436 (3.3% increase)
- Would bring RMSE from 2.209 ‚Üí ~2.0

#### Priority 3: Missing High-Scoring Games
- Games with 11-12 total goals predicted at 5-6 goals
- Model doesn't capture variance well (expected with Poisson models)
- Acceptable for betting, but worth investigating

## üìä WORST PREDICTIONS (All Under-Predicted)

1. **OTT @ BUF** (10/15): Predicted 5.79, Actual 12 ‚Üí **-6.21 error**
2. **ANA @ BOS** (10/23): Predicted 6.02, Actual 12 ‚Üí **-5.98 error**
3. **CHI @ STL** (10/15): Predicted 5.79, Actual 11 ‚Üí **-5.21 error**
4. **MTL @ EDM** (10/23): Predicted 5.87, Actual 11 ‚Üí **-5.13 error**
5. **UTA @ STL** (10/23): Predicted 5.91, Actual 11 ‚Üí **-5.09 error**

**Pattern**: All are high-scoring outlier games

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS (Prioritized)

### IMMEDIATE: Fix Win Probability Function
**File**: `src/utils/dataProcessing.js` ‚Üí `estimateWinProbability()`

**Actions**:
1. Review function logic
2. Verify home ice advantage is applied
3. Check `k` parameter value
4. Test with sample games to ensure differentiation

**Expected Result**: Win accuracy 44% ‚Üí 55%+

### SHORT-TERM: Adjust Calibration Constant
**File**: `src/utils/dataProcessing.js` ‚Üí `HISTORICAL_CALIBRATION`

**Change**: `1.39` ‚Üí `1.436` (or `1.42-1.44` range)

**Expected Result**: 
- RMSE: 2.209 ‚Üí ~2.0
- Bias: -0.358 ‚Üí ~0.0

### MONITOR: Re-run Accuracy Test
After each fix, run:
```bash
node scripts/test2025Accuracy.js
```

## üì¶ COMMITS MADE

1. **HOTFIX: Revert useMemo that broke production**
   - Removed problematic memoization
   - All duplicate-fix improvements still intact

2. **ACCURACY TEST: 2025-26 early season validation complete**
   - Created comprehensive test script
   - Generated detailed reports
   - Identified critical win probability issue

---

## üîÑ PENDING TASKS (Manual Testing Required)

The following tasks require you to manually test on the live site:

1. ‚è≥ Test that odds changes update the same bet (not create duplicate)
2. ‚è≥ Test that total line movements update the same bet
3. ‚è≥ Test with multiple page reloads don't create duplicates

**How to Test**:
1. Deploy the hotfix
2. Wait for odds to change on a game
3. Check Firebase to verify only 1 document per game+market
4. Verify document was updated (check history array)

---

## üìà NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Fix win probability function** (critical for betting utility)
2. **Adjust calibration constant** (improve total goals accuracy)
3. **Manual test duplicate prevention** (verify fixes work in production)
4. **Consider variance modeling** (for high-scoring game outliers)

---
