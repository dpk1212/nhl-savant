# Firebase Cloud Functions Status Report

## 🎯 WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### ✅ Phase 1: Diagnosis Complete
**Problem Identified:**
- Site shows "No Games Today" because odds files contain **tomorrow's games** (THU 10/23)
- **Tonight's games (WED 10/22) are LIVE right now** but not in odds files
- OddsTrader removes live games from their main page once they start

**Root Cause:**
- Your odds scraper only gets *future* games
- Once games start, they disappear from OddsTrader
- You need live score updates to show in-progress games

### ✅ Phase 2: Deployment Complete
- Rebuilt app with latest code
- Deployed to `public/` directory
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

### ✅ Phase 3: Firebase Functions Code Complete
**Created Files:**
1. **`functions/index.js`** - Cloud Function that:
   - Runs every 5 minutes automatically
   - Fetches live scores from NHL API
   - Saves to Firestore: `live_scores/current`
   - Handles "yesterday until 6 AM" logic
   
2. **`src/hooks/useLiveScores.js`** - React hook that:
   - Subscribes to Firestore in real-time
   - Auto-updates when scores change
   - Returns `{scores, loading, lastUpdate}`

3. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - `.firebaserc` - Project config
   - `firebase.json` - Functions settings
   - `functions/package.json` - Dependencies

**All code is ready and pushed to GitHub!**

## 🚧 WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Firebase Blaze Plan Required

**Firebase Functions require the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan.**

Your project is currently on the **Spark (free) plan**, which doesn't support Cloud Functions.

**Action Required:**
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nhl-savant/usage/details
2. Upgrade to Blaze plan
3. Don't worry about cost - **it's still free for your usage!**

**Cost Analysis:**
```
Firebase Functions Free Tier (included with Blaze):
- 2,000,000 invocations/month FREE
- Your usage: ~9,000/month (5-min intervals, 60 days/season)
- Monthly cost: $0.00 ✅

Firestore Free Tier:
- 50,000 reads/day FREE
- 20,000 writes/day FREE  
- Your usage: ~300 writes/day, ~1,000 reads/day
- Monthly cost: $0.00 ✅

TOTAL MONTHLY COST: $0.00
```

**Why Blaze is Safe:**
- You only pay if you exceed free limits
- Your app will never exceed free limits
- You can set budget alerts ($1, $5, $10)
- You can disable functions anytime

## 📋 DEPLOYMENT STEPS (After Upgrading)

### Step 1: Upgrade Firebase Plan
```bash
# Visit in browser:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nhl-savant/usage/details

# Click "Modify plan" → "Select Blaze"
# Add credit card (required, but won't be charged)
# Set budget alert to $1.00 for safety
```

### Step 2: Deploy Functions
```bash
cd /Users/dalekolnitys/NHL\ Savant/nhl-savant
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Expected output:
```
✔  functions: Finished running predeploy script.
i  functions: updating Node.js 22 function updateLiveScores...
i  functions: updating Node.js 22 function triggerScoreUpdate...
✔  functions[updateLiveScores(us-central1)] Successful update operation.
✔  functions[triggerScoreUpdate(us-central1)] Successful update operation.
✔  Deploy complete!
```

### Step 3: Verify Functions are Running
```bash
# Check function logs
firebase functions:log

# Should see:
# "Starting live scores update..."
# "Updated X games in Firestore"
```

### Step 4: Test Manually
```bash
# Trigger function manually (optional)
curl https://us-central1-nhl-savant.cloudfunctions.net/triggerScoreUpdate
```

### Step 5: Integrate into React App

**Update `src/components/TodaysGames.jsx`:**

```javascript
import { useLiveScores } from '../hooks/useLiveScores';

const TodaysGames = ({ dataProcessor, ...props }) => {
  const { scores: liveScores } = useLiveScores();
  
  // Merge live scores with game predictions
  const gamesWithScores = allEdges.map(edge => {
    const liveScore = liveScores.find(s => 
      s.awayTeam === edge.game.awayTeam && 
      s.homeTeam === edge.game.homeTeam
    );
    
    return {
      ...edge,
      liveScore: liveScore
    };
  });
  
  // Use gamesWithScores instead of allEdges for rendering
  // ...
};
```

**Display live scores in UI:**
```javascript
{liveScore && (
  <div className="live-score">
    {liveScore.status === 'LIVE' && '🔴 LIVE'}
    {liveScore.status === 'FINAL' && 'FINAL'}
    <span>{liveScore.awayScore} - {liveScore.homeScore}</span>
    {liveScore.period && <span>Period {liveScore.period}</span>}
    {liveScore.clock && <span>{liveScore.clock}</span>}
  </div>
)}
```

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS

### ✅ Working Right Now:
- Manual live score updater: `npm run update-scores-live`
- Shows live scores from `public/live_scores.json`
- Games visible until 6 AM next day
- All code ready for automatic updates

### ⏳ Waiting On:
- Firebase Blaze plan upgrade
- Firebase Function deployment
- React integration (5 minutes after deployment)

### 🔄 Temporary Workaround:
Keep running the Node.js script for tonight:
```bash
cd /Users/dalekolnitys/NHL\ Savant/nhl-savant
npm run update-scores-live
```

This will update scores every 3 minutes until you close the terminal.

---

## 🚀 AFTER DEPLOYMENT

Once Firebase Functions are deployed:

1. **No more manual scripts needed!**
2. Scores update automatically every 5 minutes
3. Works 24/7 without your intervention
4. Real-time updates in React via Firestore
5. Zero monthly cost

---

## 📊 FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES

After deployment, update Firestore rules in Firebase Console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Live scores - public read, function write only
    match /live_scores/{document} {
      allow read: if true;  // Anyone can read
      allow write: if false;  // Only Functions can write
    }
    
    // Existing bet tracking rules
    match /bets/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Firebase deploy fails:
```bash
# 1. Check you're logged in
firebase login

# 2. Check project is selected
firebase use nhl-savant

# 3. Check Node version
node --version  # Should be 22+

# 4. Reinstall dependencies
cd functions && npm install && cd ..
```

### If Function doesn't run:
```bash
# Check logs
firebase functions:log

# Look for errors
firebase functions:log --only updateLiveScores

# Test manually
curl https://us-central1-nhl-savant.cloudfunctions.net/triggerScoreUpdate
```

### If Firestore doesn't update:
1. Open Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Check `live_scores/current` document exists
3. Check `lastUpdate` timestamp is recent
4. Check `games` array has data
