# ✅ LIVE SCORES NOW WORKING!

## What Was Fixed

The premium live score display you saw in the screenshot is now **fully functional**! Here's what was done:

### 1. **Live Score Fetcher Enhanced**
- `updateLiveScores.js` now handles all NHL game states correctly
- Added support for **CRIT** (critical/final moments) status
- Optionally saves to both JSON file AND Firebase (when credentials available)

### 2. **Hook Updated to Use JSON Polling**
- `useLiveScores` hook now reads from `/public/live_scores.json`
- Polls every 30 seconds for updates
- Cache-busting ensures fresh data

### 3. **Premium Display Active**
- When a game is **LIVE**: Shows real-time scores with pulsing red indicator
- When a game is **FINAL**: Shows final score with green highlighting for winner
- Pre-game stats automatically hidden during live/final games
