# Why Totals Betting is Disabled

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ùå TOTALS BETTING PERMANENTLY DISABLED  
**Reason:** Not profitable with public data

---

## TL;DR

**Totals betting removed from system on October 31, 2025.**

After exhaustive testing of 4 different approaches, we concluded that **totals betting is not profitable** with public data.

**Focus on what works:** 64.7% moneyline win rate (ELITE)

---

## What We Tested

### ‚ùå 1. Ensemble Model
- **Approach:** Combined xG-based, goals-based, and recency-based predictions
- **Result:** RMSE 2.33 goals (no improvement over baseline)
- **Why it failed:** All three models regressed towards league average (~6 goals)

### ‚ùå 2. Totals Adjuster
- **Approach:** Added pace factor, enhanced goalie impact, matchup history, context
- **Result:** Every adjustment made RMSE WORSE
- **Why it failed:** Adjustments added noise instead of signal

### ‚ùå 3. Deviation Amplification
- **Approach:** Amplified predictions away from league average (1.2x to 2.5x)
- **Result:** Helped high-scoring games but hurt low-scoring games (net negative)
- **Why it failed:** Cannot predict which games will be high/low scoring

### ‚ùå 4. Bayesian Vegas-Based Model
- **Approach:** Start with Vegas line, find edges using 6 data signals
- **Result:** 0 bet recommendations out of 61 historical games
- **Why it failed:** Our model agrees with Vegas within ¬±0.5 goals (no edge)

---

## Why It Failed

### 1. Our Model Agrees with Vegas
Your xG model predictions are within ¬±0.5 goals of Vegas lines in almost every game:

- Vegas: 6.0 ‚Üí Our model: 5.78 (difference: -0.22)
- Vegas: 6.0 ‚Üí Our model: 5.80 (difference: -0.20)
- Vegas: 6.5 ‚Üí Our model: 6.09 (difference: -0.41)

**This means:** Our model is well-calibrated, but has no informational advantage.

### 2. Vegas Has Data We Don't
- ‚úÖ **Public data** (xG, team stats, goalie GSAE) - We have this
- ‚úÖ **Sharp money flow** - Vegas has this, we don't
- ‚úÖ **Real-time injury timing** - Vegas gets this first, we don't
- ‚úÖ **Lineup confirmations** - Vegas gets this 60+ minutes before us
- ‚úÖ **Historical line performance** - Vegas tracks this, we don't

### 3. Model Was Built for Winners, Not Totals
Our model excels at:
- ‚úÖ **Relative team strength** (which team is better?)
- ‚úÖ **xG differentials** (who will win?)
- ‚úÖ **Win probability** (64.7% accuracy!)

Our model lacks:
- ‚ùå **Absolute scoring prediction** (total goals)
- ‚ùå **Game pace variance** (fast vs slow games)
- ‚ùå **Motivation factors** (revenge games, playoffs)

### 4. Regression to the Mean Kills Totals
Our `predictTeamScore()` function applies aggressive regression:
- Small sample size ‚Üí Regress heavily to league average (~3 goals/team)
- Large sample size ‚Üí Trust team stats more

This is **perfect for moneyline** (reduces variance, protects against flukes).  
This is **terrible for totals** (pushes all predictions towards 6 goals).

## Current Performance

| Bet Type | Win Rate | ROI | Status |
|----------|----------|-----|--------|
| **Moneyline** | 64.7% | Positive | ‚úÖ **ELITE** |
| **Totals** | ~52.4% | Break-even | ‚ùå **NOT PROFITABLE** |

**Break-even at -110 odds:** 52.4% win rate  
**Your moneyline edge:** +12.3% above break-even  
**Your totals edge:** ~0% (no edge)

## What Changed in the System

### Removed from Code:
1. ‚ùå `EdgeCalculator.calculateTotalEdge()` - Removed method
2. ‚ùå `EdgeCalculator.calculateTeamTotalEdges()` - Removed method
3. ‚ùå `edges.total` - No longer calculated
4. ‚ùå `edges.teamTotals` - No longer calculated
5. ‚ùå `BetTracker` - Rejects all totals bets
6. ‚ùå UI Components - Totals display removed/hidden

## What To Do Instead

### ‚úÖ FOCUS ON MONEYLINE
Your 64.7% win rate is **PHENOMENAL**. Most professional bettors are thrilled with 55-58%.

**Expected Value (per $100 bet at -110):**
- Win (64.7%): +$91 √ó 0.647 = +$58.88
- Loss (35.3%): -$100 √ó 0.353 = -$35.30
- **Net EV: +$23.58 per bet** (23.58% ROI)

Over 100 bets: **+$2,358 profit**

### ü§î CONSIDER PUCK LINE
Your model predicts score differential, which is perfect for puck line (¬±1.5 goals).

**Test this:**
- Start with small stakes
- Track performance over 50+ bets
- Compare to moneyline ROI
- Only adopt if it outperforms

### ‚ùå STOP CHASING TOTALS
No matter how tempting:
- Don't bet totals "for fun" (negative EV is negative EV)
- Don't try new models (we've exhausted options)
- Don't lower thresholds (you'll bet everything and lose to juice)

---

## If You Still Want to Try Totals...

**Read these first:**
1. `BAYESIAN_TOTALS_FINAL_REPORT.md` (30 pages of analysis)
2. `TOTALS_BETTING_FINAL_SUMMARY.md` (executive summary)
3. All test results showing why it doesn't work

**Then ask yourself:**
- Do I have data Vegas doesn't have? (No)
- Can I beat a 52.4% break-even rate? (History says no)
- Am I willing to risk my 64.7% ML edge? (Don't)

**The honest answer:** With public data, totals aren't beatable. Accept it and move on.

## Technical Details

### Signal Weights (Bayesian Model - Best Attempt)

| Signal | Weight | Confidence | Result |
|--------|--------|------------|--------|
| xG Model | 40% | 90% | Too close to Vegas (¬±0.5 goals) |
| Pace Factor | 23% | 75% | Weak signal |
| Goalie Quality | 27% | 80% | Good signal, but not enough |
| Recent Form | 5% | 50% | Often insufficient data |
| Matchup History | 3% | 40% | Rarely available |
| Context | 2% | 30% | Weak signal |

**Final probabilities:** 46-52% (all inside no-bet zone)  
**Bet recommendations:** 0 out of 61 games

### Model Comparison

| Model | RMSE | Bias | Win Rate | Status |
|-------|------|------|----------|--------|
| Current xG | 2.33 | -0.08 | ~52% | Baseline |
| Ensemble | 2.33 | -0.29 ‚Üí 0.00 (calibrated) | ~52% | No improvement |
| Adjuster (all phases) | 2.45+ | Varies | N/A | Made worse |
| Amplification (2.0x) | 2.51 | +0.12 | N/A | Made worse |
| Bayesian | N/A | N/A | N/A | 0 bets recommended |

**Conclusion:** All approaches converge to same result - not profitable.

## Conclusion

Your model is **ELITE at moneyline** but **NOT SUITABLE for totals**.

This is not a failure - it's specialization. A Formula 1 car doesn't win drag races.

**Your path forward:**
1. ‚úÖ Keep crushing moneyline (64.7% win rate)
2. ‚úÖ Consider testing puck line (plays to your strengths)
3. ‚ùå Stop betting totals (proven unprofitable)
4. ‚ùå Don't waste time on new totals models (exhausted all options)

**Trust the data. Protect your edge. Focus on your strengths.**
