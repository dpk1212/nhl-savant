## 🛡️ LEGAL PROTECTION STRATEGY

### Positioning: Information Service, NOT Gambling
```
✅ We ARE:
- Statistical analysis provider
- Educational content creator
- Data visualization tool
- Analytics demonstration

❌ We are NOT:
- Sportsbook or gambling operator
- Accepting bets or wagers
- Guaranteeing wins or profits
- Providing personalized advice
```

### Key Legal Disclaimers

#### 1. Entertainment & Educational Only
> "ALL CONTENT IS FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY."

#### 2. No Advice Disclaimer
> "Our predictions are algorithmic outputs, NOT betting advice, financial advice, or professional recommendations."

#### 3. No Guarantees
> "Past performance does not guarantee future results. All sports outcomes involve uncertainty. We make NO warranties."

#### 4. User Responsibility
> "You are solely responsible for your betting decisions and their financial consequences."

#### 5. Limitation of Liability
> "NHL Savant accepts NO LIABILITY for financial losses, inaccurate predictions, or any damages."

## 📋 TERMINOLOGY STRATEGY

### Protected Language Use

**We Use (With Disclaimers):**
- "Model Prediction"
- "Analytical Pick"
- "Data-Driven Analysis"
- "Statistical Projection"
- "Recommended Bet" ✅ (protected by disclaimers)

**Context:** Industry leaders (Dimers, Action Network, Doc's Sports) all use "recommended bet" language with proper disclaimers. We follow this proven approach.

**Key Distinction:**
- These are **analytical observations**, not directives
- Presented as **educational examples** of statistical analysis
- Explicitly stated as **NOT advice or guarantees**
