# âœ… UI Fixes & Auto-Deploy - COMPLETE!

## What Was Fixed

### PRIORITY 1: UI Improvements âœ…

#### 1. Fixed Goalie Count Display
**Problem:** Showed "4/10 Goalies" instead of correct count  
**Cause:** Old data format didn't have `confirmed` property  
**Solution:** Updated logic to handle both old and new formats

```javascript
// Now checks: if goalie name exists AND not explicitly false â†’ count as confirmed
if (game.away?.goalie && (game.away?.confirmed !== false)) confirmed++;
```

**Result:** Now correctly shows actual confirmed goalies (e.g., "8/8 Goalies" or "6/8 Goalies")

---

#### 2. Improved Odds Timestamp Display
**Problem:** Timestamp was small and easy to miss ("ðŸ“Š 8m ago")  
**Solution:** Made it more prominent and clear

**Changes:**
- Larger font size (0.8rem vs 0.75rem)
- More padding
- Brighter color (#60A5FA)
- Added "Odds:" prefix
- Better wording ("Updated 8m ago" instead of just "8m ago")

**Result:** "ðŸ“Š Odds: Updated 8m ago" - much clearer!

---

#### 3. Verified Goalie Stats Section
**Status:** Already working correctly! âœ…

- `GoalieMatchupSection` is properly imported in `AdvancedMatchupDetails.jsx`
- Component renders with correct props (`awayGoalie`, `homeGoalie`, etc.)
- Shows full analytics when both goalies confirmed
- Shows waiting state when goalies not confirmed

---

### PRIORITY 2: Auto-Deploy Automation âœ…

#### Added Automatic Deployment to Workflow

**What Changed:**
Added new step to `.github/workflows/fetch-data.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Build and deploy to GitHub Pages
  if: success()
  run: |
    npm run build
    npm run deploy
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**What This Does:**
1. Only runs if scraping succeeded
2. Builds production bundle (`npm run build`)
3. Deploys to `gh-pages` branch (`npm run deploy`)
4. Uses built-in GitHub token (no secrets needed!)
