# TOTALS MODEL FIX - STATUS UPDATE

**Date:** 2025-10-31

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Complex Adjustments
- ❌ Pace Factor: Made it WORSE (+0.157 RMSE)
- ❌ Enhanced Goalie: Made it WORSE
- ❌ Matchup History: Made it WORSE
- ❌ Context: Made it WORSE

### Attempt 2: Simple Amplification
- Amplify deviations from mean by 20%
- Result: ❌ Made it WORSE (+0.012 RMSE)

## The Core Problem

**Your model regresses everything to ~6 total goals.**

| Game Type | Actual | Predicted | Error |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| High-scoring (>7) | 9-12 goals | ~6 goals | -3.3 goals |
| Low-scoring (<5) | 1-4 goals | ~6 goals | +2.9 goals |
| Average (5-7) | 5-7 goals | ~6 goals | Small |

## Why Adjustments Failed

1. **Pace Factor** - Calculated incorrectly, reduced totals when it should increase them
2. **Goalie** - Fixed direction but still made it worse
3. **Amplification** - Not aggressive enough

## Current Status

**RMSE: Still 2.40 goals (40% error rate)**

No improvements achieved yet. The model is fundamentally over-regressing to the mean.

## Next Options

### Option A: MORE AGGRESSIVE Amplification
Try amplifying deviations by 50% instead of 20%

### Option B: Accept Defeat on Totals
- Your ML model is elite (64.7%)
- Focus on that instead of totals
- Don't bet totals until you have better data/approach

### Option C: Completely Different Approach
- Use Vegas lines as baseline
- Only bet when your edge > 0.5 goals
- Stop trying to predict from scratch

## Recommendation

**OPTION B: Stop betting totals, focus on ML**

Your 64.7% moneyline win rate is elite. That's where your edge is. Totals prediction requires fundamentally different data or approach.

**If you insist on fixing totals:**
- Try Option A (more aggressive amplification)
- But expect it may still not work
- The problem is deeper than simple adjustments can fix

---

**Bottom Line:** Sometimes the right answer is to stick with what you're good at (ML) rather than forcing something that doesn't work (totals).
