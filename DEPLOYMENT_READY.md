## 📊 **Commit 2: Optimal Stats/Data Display** (`6d26fbf`)

### Humanized Names, Implied Odds, Color Coding

**1. QuickStory Component** ✅
```
📖 THE QUICK STORY
Minnesota's elite defense (#3 xGA, #1 blocks) faces Carolina's struggling 
offense (bottom-10 high-danger chances). Both goalies rank top-12 in GSAE. 
Our model projects 5.8 total goals; market has 6.5. Edge: UNDER
```
**Location:** Between Hero Bet Card and Compact Factors

**2. Stat Name Humanization** ✅
- Created mapping for 100+ stats
- All technical names converted to plain English
- Added tooltips for all complex stats
- Examples:
  - `scoreAdj_xGF_per60` → **Expected Goals For**
  - `PDO` → **Luck Index (PDO)** + tooltip
  - `highDangerChancesFor` → **High-Danger Chances Created**

**3. Color-Coded Stats** ✅
- All stats now color-coded relative to league average
- 5-tier system:
  - 🟢 **Elite** (115%+ of league avg)
  - 🟢 **Above Avg** (108-115%)
  - ⚪ **Average** (95-108%)
  - 🟡 **Below Avg** (85-95%)
  - 🔴 **Poor** (<85%)
- Shown with icons: ⬆️ Elite, → Average, ⬇️ Poor

**4. Implied Odds in Markets** ✅
```
MIN  +150
Book: 40%  Model: 48%  (+8pts edge)  |  EV: +12.3%  STRONG ✓
```
- Shows on hover for ALL markets
- Always visible for best bets
- Displays Book vs Model vs Edge in points

**5. Value Labels ON Comparison Bars** ✅
```
MIN: 2.84 ████████████████░░░░ ⬆️ Elite
Avg: 2.47 ░░░░░░░░░░│
CAR: 2.31 ████████████░░░░░░░░ ⬇️ Below Avg
League Avg: 2.47
```

**Impact:**

## ⚡ **Commit 3: Quick Hits** (`bcecfc0`)

### Advanced Analytics Preview

**Quick Hits Feature** ✅
- Shows top 3 insights when analytics section is collapsed
- Auto-generated from:
  - Danger zone advantages
  - Physical play (shot blocking, hits)
  - Regression indicators (PDO)
  - Possession dominance (Corsi)
- Includes "View Full Breakdown →" button
- Uses Zap icon and accent colors

**Example:**
```
⚡ QUICK HITS
• MIN generates 3.2 more high-danger chances per game

```
