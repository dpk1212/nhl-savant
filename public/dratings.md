## Predictions Methodology

Below are our projections for all of the games in college basketball today. The projections that we provide are now at a “Level 3” (see more at our [predictions disclaimer](https://www.dratings.com/about/predictions-disclaimer/) for details). Our proprietary algorithm takes a variety of factors into account that are all predictive in projecting the winner and score.
