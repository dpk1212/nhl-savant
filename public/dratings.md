## Predictions Methodology

Below are our projections for all of the games in college basketball today. The projections that we provide are now at a “Level 3” (see more at our [predictions disclaimer](https://www.dratings.com/about/predictions-disclaimer/) for details). Our proprietary algorithm takes a variety of factors into account that are all predictive in projecting the winner and score.

Note that we are an information site, and this information should be used for entertainment purposes only.
