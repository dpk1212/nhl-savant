OddsTrader has live betting odds for every college basketball game from the start of the season through March Madness. Betting lines update every 30 seconds for upcoming games and every 10 seconds for live games, ensuring that you’re always looking at the latest odds.

OddsTrader has also partnered with some of the top sportsbooks in the industry to bring you the best NCAAB odds from the most reliable sources.

## Using the NCAAB Odds Grid

Our college basketball odds grid is designed to be as intuitive as possible, but there are some helpful features that may not be immediately apparent. Here’s what you’ll find from left to right:

- **Matchup:** The game is presented on the far left. Above it, you’ll find the date and time of the event. If a team is ranked, it will appear beside the school name.
- **Consensus Line:** The best odds available for either team, complete with the sportsbook that line is available at.
- **Opening Line:** The odds that were available for either team when the market first opened.
- **The Odds:** The line that each sportsbook is offering.
- **Dropdown Menus:** These allow you to change which bet type is displayed, choose which period of the game you’re betting on, and filter by conference.
- **Calendar:** Pick any date to view historical odds and matchups.

### Get Matchup-Specific Betting Insights

Deeper betting insights can be found by tapping any matchup. You’ll find a wide variety of tabs inside with vital information that can help you make informed decisions.

- **Betcast and Plays:** Available in-game. Allows you to follow along with the action as it happens and check live stats.
- **Matchup:** Compare ATS records, team stats, recent results, head-to-head matchups, and more.
- **Prediction:** Our expert picks and best bets for the spread, moneyline, and total.
- **Odds:** Expected value, cover probability, and best available line for a wide range of markets.
- **Player Props:** Top player prop betting picks with bet ratings and best available lines.
- **Game Props:** Top game props available and the best lines for each market.
- **Injuries:** Any pertinent injury and health updates for both teams.

You’ll also notice a dropdown menu on each tab. Click it for more information related to each topic.

## Live Odds for March Madness

March Madness is the busiest time of the year for college basketball fans, and OddsTrader has you covered. Our odds grid updates every 10 seconds for live games, allowing you to follow along with the action in real time – all in one spot.

Our odds aren’t limited to the standard NCAA Tournament, either. The NIT, CBI, and Crown tournaments are also available, meaning you can keep up with the more niche action, too.
