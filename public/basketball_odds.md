- **Calendar:** Pick any date to view historical odds and matchups.

### Get Matchup-Specific Betting Insights

Deeper betting insights can be found by tapping any matchup. You’ll find a wide variety of tabs inside with vital information that can help you make informed decisions.

## Live Odds for March Madness

March Madness is the busiest time of the year for college basketball fans, and OddsTrader has you covered. Our odds grid updates every 10 seconds for live games, allowing you to follow along with the action in real time – all in one spot.

Our odds aren’t limited to the standard NCAA Tournament, either. The NIT, CBI, and Crown tournaments are also available, meaning you can keep up with the more niche action, too.
