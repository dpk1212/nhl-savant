OddsTrader has live betting odds for every college basketball game from the start of the season through March Madness. Betting lines update every 30 seconds for upcoming games and every 10 seconds for live games, ensuring that you’re always looking at the latest odds.

OddsTrader has also partnered with some of the top sportsbooks in the industry to bring you the best NCAAB odds from the most reliable sources. Caesars, bet365, and BetMGM are just some of the betting sites we pull live odds from.

## Using the NCAAB Odds Grid

Our college basketball odds grid is designed to be as intuitive as possible, but there are some helpful features that may not be immediately apparent. Here’s what you’ll find from left to right:

- **Matchup:** The game is presented on the far left. Above it, you’ll find the date and time of the event. If a team is ranked, it will appear beside the school name.
- **Consensus Line:** The best odds available for either team, complete with the sportsbook that line is available at.
- **Opening Line:** The odds that were available for either team when the market first opened.
