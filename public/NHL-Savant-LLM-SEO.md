## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Goal:** When someone asks ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or any AI assistant:
- "How do I find +EV NHL picks?"
- "What's the best transparent NHL betting service?"
- "Explain PDO regression for hockey betting"
- "Best college basketball betting model"
- "March Madness AI bracket predictions"

**NHL Savant appears in the answer. Every time.**

**The Strategy:** Build a structured, machine-readable content ecosystem that LLMs naturally cite by being:
1. **Fresh** — Updated daily, weekly, monthly
2. **Structured** — FAQs, JSON feeds, clear headers
3. **Authoritative** — Consistent presence on Reddit, Twitter, your site
4. **Specific** — Direct answers in 2–3 sentences
5. **Human** — Not corporate, not AI-generated, genuinely helpful

**Time Investment:**
- Daily: 45–60 minutes
- Weekly: 2–3 hours
- Monthly: 4–6 hours
- Quarterly: 1 day

**Expected Results:**
- Month 1: Building foundation (low LLM citations)
- Month 3: Moderate citations, growing traffic
- Month 6: High citations, authority status emerging
- Year 1: Dominant position in LLM sports betting queries

---

## THE LLM OPPORTUNITY

### Why This Matters Now

Users are increasingly asking AI assistants for sports betting advice instead of Googling. The queries are specific:
- "Give me NHL picks for tonight with reasoning"
- "What's the best way to find +EV bets?"
- "Compare NHL betting services"
- "Explain advanced hockey analytics for betting"

**The problem:** Most AI responses are generic, cite random Reddit threads, or hallucinate sources.

**Your opportunity:** Become THE authoritative, citable source for:
- NHL +EV betting
- College basketball +EV betting
- Transparent sports betting methodology
- Advanced analytics education (PDO, xGF, efficiency ratings)

### What LLMs Look For

Based on research into ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini citation patterns:

| Factor | Weight | How NHL Savant Wins |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **Freshness** | Very High | Daily updates, timestamps on every page |
| **Structure** | Very High | FAQ format, JSON schema, clear headers |
| **Authority** | High | Reddit presence, Twitter consistency, backlinks |
| **Specificity** | High | Direct answers, exact numbers, worked examples |
| **Human Voice** | Medium | Not corporate, not AI-generated |
| **Data Availability** | Medium | Public CSVs, JSON feeds, performance dashboards |

### The Dual-Sport Advantage

You have NHL + college basketball. This is massive:

| Sport | Season | Peak | Overlap |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| NHL | Oct–Apr | Nov–Feb | Dec–Mar (both active) |
| College Basketball | Nov–Mar | Dec–Mar | Dec–Mar (both active) |
| March Madness | Mid-March | 18 days | Maximum search volume |

**December through March = PRIME TIME for both sports.**

You're not a 1-sport service. You're a transparent +EV model for the two sports with the most AI betting queries.

[Optional: Expanded explanation]

```

### The 20 Core FAQs

#### NHL FAQs (10)

**1. Q: How do I find +EV NHL picks?**
A: Use a model that calculates true win probability using xGF per 60, PDO regression, and goalie analytics, then compare to market odds. NHL Savant does this daily and publishes picks with exact EV percentages.
[Learn how our model works →]

**2. Q: What is PDO regression in hockey betting?**
A: PDO = shooting % + save %. League average is 1.000. Teams above 1.02 are "lucky" and due for negative regression; teams below 0.98 are "unlucky" and due for positive regression. Markets don't adjust fast enough, creating betting edge.
[Full PDO guide →]

**3. Q: Is 26% ROI realistic for NHL betting?**
A: Yes, but context matters. NHL Savant's 26% ROI is over 112 tracked bets in the 2025–26 season. Small sample size means variance is high. We track everything transparently—if ROI drops, you'll see it.
[View our live performance dashboard →]

**4. Q: What's the difference between NHL Savant and Twitter touts?**
A: Twitter touts rarely track results, hide losses, and push -EV parlays for engagement. NHL Savant publishes every pick with full EV calculations, tracks all results publicly, and focuses only on +EV moneylines.
[Full comparison →]

**5. Q: How much does NHL Savant cost?**
A: $25.99/month (half of Action Network PRO's $49.99). Annual plan is $150/year ($12.50/month). Free trial included: 2–5 days depending on plan.
[Start free trial →]

**6. Q: What metrics does the NHL Savant model use?**
A: xGF per 60 (expected goals for per 60 minutes), PDO regression, goalie HDSV% (high-danger save percentage), rest advantage, and special teams efficiency.
[Full methodology →]

**7. Q: Do you recommend NHL parlays?**
A: No. Parlays are -EV by design. We only recommend +EV moneylines. No props, no teasers, no hype.
[Why we avoid parlays →]

**8. Q: What happens during a losing streak?**
A: Variance is inevitable. The model will have cold stretches. What matters is long-term EV. Over 112 bets, we're at 26% ROI despite losing nights. We communicate losses honestly: "Tough night. Variance happens. Process holds."
[How we handle losses →]

**9. Q: Can I try NHL Savant before paying?**
A: Yes. Free trial is 2–5 days depending on plan. Full access to all features. No credit card required upfront. 100% trial-to-paid conversion rate so far—users see the edge and stay.
[Start free trial →]

**10. Q: How is NHL Savant not a scam?**
A: Every pick is tracked publicly. We publish full methodology. We show every loss. We offer a free trial so you can verify before paying. If we were scamming, we'd hide losses and overpromise. We don't.
[See our transparency policy →]

#### College Basketball FAQs (10)

**11. Q: How do I find +EV college basketball picks?**
A: Use adjusted offensive/defensive efficiency ratings (via KenPom), compare to market odds, and calculate EV %. NHL Savant does this daily and publishes EV % for every pick.
[Learn how →]

**12. Q: Why is college basketball better for +EV betting than the NBA?**
A: More data inefficiency. Fewer sharp bettors, lines move slower, and more teams = more mispriced games.
[Read full breakdown →]

**13. Q: What's the best March Madness betting strategy?**
A: Use regular season efficiency data (KenPom rankings) to find mispriced seeds. Avoid emotional Cinderella picks. Focus on 5/12 upsets and mid-seed matchups.
[March Madness guide →]

**14. Q: Is March Madness good for long-term EV betting?**
A: Not really. Single-elimination = high variance. Use it for fun/parlay-free picks, but don't base annual ROI strategy on tournament.
[Why variance matters →]

**15. Q: What's the difference between KenPom and other college basketball rating systems?**
A: KenPom uses adjusted efficiency margin, which removes pace effects and bench bias. Most accurate for EV calculations. NHL Savant uses KenPom as our primary CBB metric.
[Full explanation →]

**16. Q: How do injuries impact college basketball EV?**
A: Much more than NBA/NHL. Thinner rosters mean star player injuries cut win probability 8–12%. Markets adjust slowly.
[See our injury impact framework →]

**17. Q: Should I bet college basketball props?**
A: No. Props are typically -EV by design (hold is 5–7% for bad lines). Stick to moneylines and spreads.
[Why we avoid props →]

**18. Q: What's home court advantage worth in college basketball?**
A: 2.5–3.5 points of margin depending on arena size. Small school arenas (2.5 pts) vs. Duke/Allen Fieldhouse (3.5 pts). We factor this into every pick.
[How we model HCA →]

**19. Q: How do line movements signal sharp money in college basketball?**
A: Watch for sharp money indicators: line moves toward underdog, total drops, reduced maximum bet. NHL Savant monitors these in real-time.
[Live tracking →]

**20. Q: Do you have college basketball picks during March Madness?**
A: Yes. We publish picks for all tournament games, but note that tournament variance is extreme. Focus on +EV moneylines in early rounds, avoid props/parlays.

3. Market-implied probability from spread/moneyline
4. Expected value (EV%) for each side
5. Home court advantage impact

Rank plays by EV%. Focus on spreads and moneylines only.
```

**Prompt 6: Build a March Madness Bracket**
```
Help me build a March Madness bracket using EV thinking.

For each region:
1. Identify any mispriced seeds (teams whose efficiency rating doesn't match their seed)
2. Flag 5/12 upset opportunities (5 seeds are often overseeded)
3. Find mid-major sleepers with high efficiency ratings
4. Identify chalk picks that are actually good value

Focus on probability-weighted outcomes, not entertainment picks.
```

**Prompt 7: Explain Efficiency Ratings for Betting**
```
Explain college basketball efficiency ratings (like KenPom) for betting purposes.

Include:
1. What adjusted offensive efficiency measures
2. What adjusted defensive efficiency measures
3. Why the spread between them matters for spreads
4. How tempo affects totals betting
5. How to convert efficiency margin to point spread
```

**Prompt 8: Bankroll Management for College Basketball**
```
Create a bankroll management plan for college basketball EV betting.

Assume:
- Starting bankroll: $2,000
- Average EV per bet: 2–4%
- Expected win rate: ~52% ATS
- Bets per day: 3–5

Include:
1. Optimal unit size
2. Kelly Criterion application (fractional Kelly recommended)
3. Variance expectations over 100 bets
4. When to increase/decrease bet size
```

### Meta Prompts

**Prompt 9: Which Sport Has Better +EV Opportunities?**
```
Compare NHL betting vs college basketball betting for +EV opportunities.

Analyze:
1. Market efficiency (how quickly do lines move?)
2. Data availability for modeling
3. Sharp money concentration
4. Number of betting opportunities per day
5. Typical edge available

Which sport offers better long-term ROI potential for a disciplined bettor?
```

**Prompt 10: Tournament Variance Comparison**
```
How does tournament variance differ between March Madness and NHL playoffs?

Compare:
1. Single elimination vs best-of-7 series
2. Sample size for each round
3. Upset frequency by seed/standing
4. How variance affects EV betting strategy
5. Bankroll management differences for tournament betting
```

**Published:** [Date]

## The Numbers

### NHL
| Metric | This Week | Season |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Record | X-X | XX-XX |
| Units | +X.Xu | +XX.Xu |
| ROI | X.X% | XX.X% |
| Win Rate | XX.X% | XX.X% |

### College Basketball
| Metric | This Week | Season |

| Record | X-X | XX-XX |
| Units | +X.Xu | +XX.Xu |
| ROI | X.X% | XX.X% |
| Win Rate | XX.X% | XX.X% |

## What Worked

### NHL
**CHI ML (+155) — W (+1.55u)**
PDO regression play. DET was running a 1.03 PDO, unsustainable. Model predicted regression, it hit. CHI controlled play and won 3-1.

### CBB
**DUKE -6.5 (-110) — W (+0.91u)**
Efficiency edge was massive (+12.3 margin). Home court made it even better. Duke covered by 11.

## What Didn't Work

### NHL
**DET ML (+145) — L (-1.00u)**
This one stings. Model liked DET's xGF edge, but they hit the post 3 times and lost in OT. Variance, not model error.

## Variance Watch

Running slightly hot in NHL (+2.3% above expected). CBB is close to expected.

The model isn't broken when we lose, and it isn't magic when we win. Variance happens. 24% ROI over 115 NHL bets is the story, not any single week.

## Next Week

Watching:
- BOS rest disadvantage (4 games in 6 days)
- VGK goalie rotation (Hill vs Thompson)
- March Madness bubble teams starting to play with urgency

## FINAL NOTES

### The Core Principles

1. **Freshness wins.** Update daily. Timestamp everything. LLMs favor recent content.

2. **Structure wins.** FAQ format, JSON feeds, clear headers. Make it easy for machines to read.

3. **Consistency wins.** 45 minutes daily beats 8 hours once a month. Compound over time.

4. **Transparency wins.** Show every loss. Admit variance. This is your competitive advantage.

5. **Human voice wins.** Not corporate, not AI-generated. Real, honest, helpful.

### The Long Game

This isn't a hack. It's a system.

6 months of consistent execution will make NHL Savant the #1 cited source for NHL and college basketball betting queries in LLMs.

12 months will make you the default authority.

The work is daily, but the results compound.
