## **Today’s Prop Picks – November 5, 2025**

**Elias Pettersson Anytime Goal (+1400 vs Chicago)**

Pettersson has been generating consistent scoring chances and carries a projection of **0.569 goals** for tonight’s matchup. Despite a modest **43% cover probability**, the **+1400** price tag brings strong **expected value (+36.7%)** for bettors looking for an aggressive payout on a high-upside sniper. Chicago’s defensive gaps make this a solid speculative play for those chasing a big number.

**Colton Parayko Under 1.5 Blocked Shots (+145 vs Washington)**

Parayko’s blocked-shot average sits at **1.231 per game**, and with a **65% probability** of staying under the line, the **Under 1.5 (+145)** prop carries real value ( **+24.3% expected return**). He’s covered this line in **7 of 11** games (64%), but Washington’s lower shot volume from the blue line supports the under as a strong situational spot.

## **Best NHL Bets Toda** y

Looking for the sharpest NHL player props tonight? The **most reliable bets** usually come from volume markets like shots and saves, while goal scorer picks add bigger payouts when the matchup is right.

You’ll find today’s top props, updated daily with expert insights, player trends, and predictive models that flag real value not just obvious names.

The props listed here are updated daily, blending real bettor insights with predictive models to highlight value plays worth considering. Every recommendation is designed to help you find sharper bets, [not just obvious picks](https://www.oddstrader.com/today/picks).

For real-time line movement and the best odds available across multiple sportsbooks, [**use the OddsTrader app**](https://www.oddstrader.com/sports-betting-app). It’s built to track props as they shift so you never settle for a bad number.

## **NHL Player Prop Bet**

NHL player prop bets focus on individual performance rather than team results. The three most common markets are:

- **Shot Props**: Over/under totals on how many shots a player records. These are usually the most reliable props because shot volume is tied to role and ice time. A forward on the top line or power-play unit will typically generate steadier attempts than a depth winger.

- **Goal Scorer Props**: Anytime goals, first goal, or multi-goal bets. These carry bigger payouts but are harder to project since finishing is less consistent than shooting volume. They’re best approached when a player is in form or facing a weak defensive matchup.

- **Save Props**: Goalie over/unders on total saves. These depend heavily on pace of play and opponent quality. A goaltender facing a high-shot team like Florida or Colorado will often see inflated save totals, while slower matchups can suppress the number.


**[Sportsbooks set these lines](http://www.oddstrader.com/sports-betting-app)** using recent performance, line combinations, and time on ice. Late injury news, goalie confirmations, or lineup changes can shift the numbers quickly.

**Pro tip:** Shot and save props usually provide more consistent betting value because they’re volume-driven, while goal props carry more variance and depend on puck luck.

**Before placing a bet, compare real-time prop odds with OddsTrader**. The tool scans multiple sportsbooks and updates instantly, helping you spot the best NHL player prop odds available. You can filter by market, matchup, or rating to quickly find the top NHL prop bets today.

### **Shot Props Today**

**Over/under shot totals** are one of the most popular NHL props because volume is easier to project than goals. Sportsbooks set these lines based on a player’s recent averages, role, and matchup, then adjust depending on betting action.

Certain players are reliable volume shooters. Auston Matthews, David Pastrnak, and Nathan MacKinnon often **clear 3.5 or 4.5 shot lines** because they drive play and rarely pass up opportunities. On the other end, secondary forwards may see lower totals that depend more on power-play usage or line assignments.

Examples:

- **Auston Matthews O/U 3.5 shots** – facing a defense that allows heavy shot volume from the slot.

- **David Pastrnak O/U 4.5 shots** – consistent high-volume shooter with top power-play minutes.

- **Connor McDavid O/U 3.5 shots** – pace of play and ice time make this a strong value spot.


**See the full shot prop board on OddsTrader**. The board updates in real time with the latest **NHL shot prop odds**, showing which players are most likely to go over or under their totals. You can sort by matchup, prop type, or rating to quickly find the best NHL shot props today.

### Goalie Props

**[NHL goalie props](https://www.oddstrader.com/betting/university/the-impact-of-goaltenders-in-nhl-betting)** usually focus on save totals. Sportsbooks set these lines based on pace of play and how many shots a goalie is expected to face. A team that generates heavy volume can push a save line higher, while slower opponents usually keep it lower.

Other common markets include **first-period save bets** and **shutout odds**. These props carry more risk but can offer value when the matchup favors a busy goalie. Backup goalies are worth monitoring since oddsmakers sometimes misprice their save totals.

Examples:

- **Igor Shesterkin O/U 29.5 saves** – projected to face a top-five team in shot attempts.

- **Juuse Saros O/U 27.5 saves** – divisional pace should create steady work over three periods.


**Insider tip:** Goalie save props have more value when the goalie is expected to face volume and stay in net for the full game. Blowouts can hurt if a starter gets pulled early.

**Track updated NHL goalie props on OddsTrader** to compare save totals across multiple sportsbooks in real time.

## **NHL Goal Scorer Prop Bets**

**NHL goal scorer props** are one of the most exciting markets because they turn every shot into a sweat. The main types you’ll find are:

- **Anytime Goal**: The player needs to score at least once during the game.

- **First Goal**: The player must score the first goal of the game.

- **Multi-Goal (2+ or Hat Trick)**: Higher payouts for players who find the net multiple times.


Chalky scorers like Auston Matthews or Connor McDavid are almost always priced with shorter odds, which limits value unless the matchup strongly favors them.

The real edge often comes from value plays, players on hot streaks, skating with top-six minutes, or recently added to a power-play unit.

Examples:

- **Auston Matthews Anytime Goal (-120)** – top-line usage and one of the league’s highest shot rates.

- **David Pastrnak Anytime Goal (+110)** – steady production and power-play exposure make him a nightly threat.

## **NHL Prop Betting Strategies**

From left to right, the **NHL Player Props Grid** shows the prop, expected value, cover probability, bet rating, and the best line available. Here’s how each part works:

- **Prop**: The suggested bet. It lists the player’s name, the prop market (shots, saves, or goals), and the matchup with date, time, and venue.

- **Expected Value**: What the grid is sorted by. This number measures the difference between the true probability of the prop hitting and the odds posted by the sportsbook.

- **Cover Probability**: The percentage chance that the prop wins.

- **Bet Rating**: A ranking of overall value. Five-star bets represent the strongest NHL player props available that day.

- **Best Line**: The most favorable odds currently posted. The grid updates in real time to surface the best NHL prop betting lines.


You’ll also find dropdown menus above the grid to filter by matchup, prop type, or bet rating. These make it easy to narrow down results and quickly locate the best NHL player props today.
