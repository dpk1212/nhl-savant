## METHODOLOGY

### Kelly Criterion Formula

```
Kelly % = (Edge / Odds) * Kelly Fraction
Edge = EV% / 100
Bet Size = min(Kelly % × Bankroll, 5% × Bankroll)
Bet Size = max(Bet Size, $5)
```

### Testing Methodology
- Each market tested with separate $500 starting bankroll
- "All Markets" combines both ML and Total bets chronologically
- Only B-rated or higher bets included (>= 3% EV)
- Results show if Kelly sizing benefits one market more than another

### Assumptions
- All bets are independent
- Edge calculations from model are accurate
- No transaction costs or taxes
- Bankroll stops trading below $100
