## üìã Manual Analysis Instructions

### Step 1: Check Your Deployed Site
Visit: https://nhl-savant.web.app (or your deployment URL)

### Step 2: For Each Game Above
Look at the "Today's Games" section and note:
- Does the game show a **+EV bet**?
- If yes, is it for the **AWAY team** or **HOME team**?
- What is the **EV percentage**?

### Step 3: Count the Results
Fill in this table:

| Game | Away Underdog | +EV Bet? | Bet Team | EV % |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|------|
| MIN @ NYR | MIN | ? | ? | ? |
| SEA @ PHI | SEA | ? | ? | ? |
| BUF @ MTL | BUF | ? | ? | ? |
| CAR @ VGK | CAR | ? | ? | ? |
| SJS @ NYI | SJS | ? | ? | ? |
| NJD @ TOR | NJD | ? | ? | ? |
| SEA @ WSH | SEA | ? | ? | ? |
| LAK @ STL | LAK | ? | ? | ? |
| CBJ @ DAL | CBJ | ? | ? | ? |
| ANA @ NSH | ANA | ? | ? | ? |

### Step 4: Calculate Bias Metric

```
Total +EV Bets: ___
+EV Bets on Away Underdogs: ___

Away Underdog % = (Away Underdog +EV Bets / Total +EV Bets) √ó 100 = ___%
```

## üö® Interpretation Guide

### ‚úÖ < 40% - NO BIAS
- Model is balanced
- Healthy distribution
- No action needed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 40-50% - SLIGHT LEAN
- Elevated but acceptable
- Monitor over larger sample
- Possibly natural variance

### üîç 50-60% - MODERATE BIAS
- Clear preference for away underdogs
- **Investigate:**
  - Early season regression (too lenient?)
  - Home ice advantage (too weak?)
  - Calibration constant (incorrect?)

### üö® > 60% - STRONG BIAS
- Systematic issue detected
- **Critical fixes needed:**
  1. Increase regression strength for <10 games
  2. Review home ice advantage calculation
  3. Check calibration constant
  4. Verify Poisson implementation

---

## üîß Potential Root Causes

### 1. **Early Season Regression Too Lenient**
- Current: 30% regression at <5 games
- Issue: Lucky bad teams appear good
- Fix: Increase to 50% regression for <10 games

### 2. **Home Ice Advantage Undervalued**
- Current: +5.8% to home team only
- Issue: Market might use symmetric adjustment
- Fix: Test +6% home, -2% away

### 3. **Calibration Constant**
- Current: 1.215 (from 2024 data)
- Issue: Might not apply to 2025 season
- Fix: Use 2025 data once available

### 4. **Poisson Underestimates Upsets**
- Current: Standard Poisson distribution
- Issue: Underestimates variance in NHL
- Fix: Consider Negative Binomial distribution

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Complete manual analysis** using your deployed site
2. **Calculate away underdog percentage**
3. **If > 50%:** Implement fixes in priority order
4. **If < 50%:** Model is likely fine, continue monitoring

---

## üéØ Expected Outcome

**Healthy Model Distribution:**
- Away Underdogs: 25-35%
- Away Favorites: 15-25%
- Home Underdogs: 15-25%
- Home Favorites: 25-35%

**Current Market Reality:**
- Home teams win ~55% of games
- Favorites win ~60% of games
- Your model should reflect this, not contradict it
