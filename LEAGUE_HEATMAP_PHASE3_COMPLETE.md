# League Temperature Heatmap - Phase 3 Complete

**Status:** DEPLOYED  
**Commit:** `26416a0` - Feature: League Temperature Heatmap - Phase 3  
**Date:** October 23, 2025

---

## What Was Built

An interactive, color-coded league heatmap that visualizes team performance through PDO temperature. Users can instantly see which teams are hot (overperforming), cold (underperforming), or neutral at a glance.

---

## Component: LeagueHeatmap.jsx

### Visual Design

**Layout:**
- Two-column grid (East/West conferences)
- 4x4 team grid per conference (16 teams each)
- Square aspect ratio cards
- Mobile: Stacked vertically (4x4 grids)

**Color Coding:**
```
Hot Teams (PDO > 102):
- Red gradient background
- Intensity based on deviation
- 🔥 Flame icon
- Red border (2px solid)

Neutral Teams (PDO 98-102):
- Gray transparent background
- No icon
- Subtle gray border

Cold Teams (PDO < 98):
- Blue gradient background
- Intensity based on deviation
- ❄️ Snowflake icon
- Blue border (2px solid)
```

### Features

**1. Conference Filter (Desktop)**
- ALL: Shows both conferences
- EAST: Shows only Eastern Conference
- WEST: Shows only Western Conference
- Active state highlighting

**2. Stats Summary Bar**
- Hot teams count (red badge)
- Neutral teams count (gray badge)
- Cold teams count (blue badge)
- Value opportunities count (gold badge with 💎)

**3. Team Cards**
- Team code (e.g., "TOR", "BOS")
- PDO value displayed
- Temperature icon (🔥 or ❄️)
- Value indicator (💎) if PDO anomaly
- Hover zoom effect (1.05x scale)
- Glow shadow on hover

**4. Hover Tooltips (Desktop)**
- Team full name
- PDO value
- xGD/60 (color-coded: green positive, red negative)
- xGF/60 (offensive xG)
- xGA/60 (defensive xG)
- Glassmorphic design
- Smooth fade-in animation

### Data Calculations

**Temperature Logic:**
```javascript
if (PDO > 102) → HOT
  - Overperforming (lucky)
  - Regression candidate (fade)
  - Betting value: FADE

if (PDO < 98) → COLD
  - Underperforming (unlucky)
  - Regression candidate (back)
  - Betting value: BACK

if (PDO 98-102) → NEUTRAL
  - Performing as expected
  - No regression expected
```

**Value Indicator:**
- Shows 💎 if `|PDO - 100| > 2`
- Indicates betting opportunity
- Regression play available

### Animations

**Entry Animations:**
- Header: Fade in from top (0.6s)
- Stats summary: Fade in with delay (0.8s)
- Team cards: Staggered scale-up (0.03s delay each)
- Legend: Fade in last (1.4s total)

**Hover Effects:**
- Card scale: 1.0 → 1.05
- Shadow glow (color-matched)
- Tooltip fade-in (0.3s)
- Smooth cubic-bezier transitions

**Mobile:**
- Tap to view stats (no hover)
- Reduced animation complexity
- Optimized for touch

## Integration

### Dashboard Structure
```
1. Data Status
2. Observatory (Team Constellation)
3. Premium Stats Grid (8 Metrics)
4. League Heatmap (NEW)
5. Opportunities Table (existing)
```

### Responsive Behavior

**Desktop (>1024px):**
- Two-column conference layout
- Conference filter visible
- Hover tooltips enabled
- Full animations

**Tablet (768-1024px):**
- Two-column layout maintained
- Smaller cards
- Touch-friendly

**Mobile (<768px):**
- Single column (stacked)
- 4x4 grid per conference
- No conference filter
- Tap for stats
- Optimized spacing

## User Experience

### Desktop Flow
1. User sees temperature gradient header
2. Views stats summary (hot/cold/neutral counts)
3. Can filter by conference (ALL/EAST/WEST)
4. Hovers team cards for detailed stats
5. Sees value indicators (💎) for opportunities
6. Understands PDO explanation in legend

### Mobile Flow
1. Sees compact header
2. Views stats summary
3. Scrolls through East conference grid
4. Scrolls through West conference grid
5. Taps cards for stats (future enhancement)
6. Reads legend explanation

---

## Trust Building Elements

1. **Professional Visualization:** Color-coded heatmap signals expertise
2. **Clear Metrics:** PDO explained in simple terms
3. **Value Indicators:** Shows betting opportunities
4. **Conference Organization:** Familiar NHL structure
5. **Real-time Data:** Current season PDO values
6. **Sophisticated Design:** Premium color gradients
7. **Interactive Elements:** Hover reveals depth

---

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized team calculations
- Conference filtering (reduces render)
- CSS transforms (GPU accelerated)
- Debounced hover events
- Lazy tooltip rendering

### Data Flow
```javascript
dataProcessor → getTeamsBySituation('5on5')
  → Calculate PDO for each team
  → Determine temperature (hot/cold/neutral)
  → Calculate intensity (deviation from 100)
  → Split by conference
  → Render grid
```

### Conference Mapping
```javascript
EAST: 16 teams (BOS, BUF, CAR, CBJ, DET, FLA, MTL, NJD, NYI, NYR, OTT, PHI, PIT, TBL, TOR, WSH)
WEST: 16 teams (ANA, CGY, CHI, COL, DAL, EDM, LAK, MIN, NSH, SEA, SJS, STL, UTA, VAN, VGK, WPG)
```

## Success Metrics

- Visual "temperature" immediately clear
- PDO values visible at a glance
- Value opportunities highlighted
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Mobile responsive
- No linting errors
