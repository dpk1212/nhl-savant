## 📊 HOW IT WORKS

### Automatic Flow (Every 5 Minutes)
```
Firebase Scheduler
  ↓ (every 5 min)
Cloud Function: updateLiveScores
  ↓
Fetch NHL API (api-web.nhle.com)
  ↓
Process game data (3 games)
  ↓
Save to Firestore: live_scores/current
  ↓
React App: useLiveScores() hook
  ↓
Real-time UI update (automatic)
```

### Date Logic (Smart)
```
If current hour < 6 AM:
  → Fetch YESTERDAY's games (show games until morning)
Else:
  → Fetch TODAY's games
```

**Why this works:**
- Tonight's games (WED 10/22) are live
- After midnight, still shows WED games until 6 AM
- At 6 AM, switches to TODAY's games (THU 10/23)

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION RESULTS

### Test 1: Manual Trigger ✅
```bash
$ curl https://us-central1-nhl-savant.cloudfunctions.net/triggerScoreUpdate

## 🔧 MONITORING & MANAGEMENT

### Check Function Status
```bash
# View logs
firebase functions:log

# Check specific function
firebase functions:log --only updateLiveScores

# List all functions
firebase functions:list
```

### Manual Trigger (Testing)
```bash
# Trigger score update now
curl https://us-central1-nhl-savant.cloudfunctions.net/triggerScoreUpdate
```

### Firebase Console
- **Functions:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nhl-savant/functions
- **Firestore:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nhl-savant/firestore
- **Usage:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nhl-savant/usage/details

### Firestore Data View
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Navigate to: `live_scores` → `current`
3. See real-time game data and last update timestamp

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If function doesn't run:
```bash
# Check logs for errors
firebase functions:log

# Manual trigger to test
curl https://us-central1-nhl-savant.cloudfunctions.net/triggerScoreUpdate

# Redeploy if needed
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### If React doesn't show live scores:
1. Check browser console for Firestore connection errors
2. Verify Firestore data exists: Firebase Console → Firestore → `live_scores/current`
3. Check `useLiveScores()` hook is returning data
4. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R

### If scores are outdated:
1. Check function logs to see if it's running every 5 minutes
2. Manually trigger: `curl https://us-central1-nhl-savant.cloudfunctions.net/triggerScoreUpdate`
3. Check Firestore `lastUpdate` timestamp
