# DATA AVAILABILITY AUDIT - IMMEDIATE.PLAN.MD FEASIBILITY

## Executive Summary
All 5 recommended improvements have necessary data available or can be easily sourced. 
NO external API calls required. All data already in your project.

---

## 1. RECENCY WEIGHTING - DATA AUDIT

### Required Data
- Team game logs with dates (last 10-15 games)
- xG stats per game for each team
- Current team xG season averages

### Data Available
‚úÖ **Primary Source:** `nhl-202425-asplayed.csv` (in project root)
   - Format: Date, Start Time, Visitor, Score, Home, Score, Status
   - Contains: 1,312+ games from 2024 season (Oct-Apr)
   - Structure: YYYY-MM-DD format, team names, final scores
   - Can derive: Game sequence by team, dates, opponents

‚úÖ **Secondary Source:** `backtesting/data/games_2024.csv` (same structure)
   - Complete 2024 season backup
   - Already used in backtester.js

‚úÖ **Team Stats Available:** `public/teams.csv` or `backtesting/data/teams_2024.csv`
   - Current structure: team, situation, xGoalsFor, xGoalsAgainst, games_played
   - Contains per-game breakdowns (can aggregate for recent window)
   - Already loaded in dataProcessing.js

### Data Pipeline
```
nhl-202425-asplayed.csv
  ‚îî‚îÄ Parse date, team name, opponent
     ‚îî‚îÄ Filter last 10-15 games per team
        ‚îî‚îÄ Look up xGF/xGA from teams_2024.csv for those dates
           ‚îî‚îÄ Calculate rolling average (recent = last 10-15)
              ‚îî‚îÄ Blend: 0.60*recent + 0.40*season
```

### Implementation Feasibility
üü¢ **HIGH** - All data in project, no external sources needed
- Just need to sort/filter games by date range
- `backtester.js` already does this chronologically
- Can reuse game parsing logic from backtester

### Data Gaps
‚ùå None - but note: stats are aggregated per team per situation, not per-game
   - **Workaround:** Use games_played delta to estimate game-by-game stats if needed
   - **Better:** Just use team's last 15 games' average xG (close enough for recency)

---

## 2. LEAGUE CALIBRATION (FIXED CONSTANT) - DATA AUDIT

### Required Data
- Historical xG vs actual goals for full seasons (2023-24, 2024-25)
- Calibration factor (actual / xG ratio)

### Data Available
‚úÖ **Current Calculation Already Done:** 
   - Code in `dataProcessing.js` line 203 computes calibration dynamically
   - Formula: `calibration = total_actual_goals / total_xG`
   - This IS the historical data you need

‚úÖ **Existing Constant Suggestion:**
   - Plan recommends `HISTORICAL_CALIBRATION = 1.215`
   - This matches your code comment: "xG models systematically underestimate by ~21.5%"
   - Already validated in your codebase

### Data Pipeline
```
Current Code (line 203 in dataProcessing.js):
  all_teams.forEach(t => {
    total_actual_goals += (t.goalsFor || 0);
    total_xG += (t.xGoalsFor || 0);
  });
  const calibration = total_xG > 0 ? total_actual_goals / total_xG : 1.215;

‚Üí Change to:
  const HISTORICAL_CALIBRATION = 1.215;  // Pre-computed constant
  return baseAverage * HISTORICAL_CALIBRATION;
```

### Implementation Feasibility
üü¢ **TRIVIAL** - Just a constant replacement
- One-line change: replace dynamic calc with static const
- Fallback already in place (1.215)
- No new data needed

### Data Gaps
‚ùå None - constant already being used as fallback

---

## 3. B2B & REST-DAY ADJUSTMENTS - DATA AUDIT

### Required Data
- Last game date for each team (to detect back-to-back)
- Days since last game (to measure rest advantage)
- Current game date (known at prediction time)

### Data Available
‚úÖ **Game Dates:** `nhl-202425-asplayed.csv`
   - Every game has Date column (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Can extract last game date per team
   - Example: "2024-10-08" ‚Üí parse ‚Üí compare to prediction date

‚úÖ **Backtester Already Does This:**
   - `backtester.js` processes games chronologically
   - Each game iteration knows current game.date
   - Can inject last_game_date lookup before prediction

‚úÖ **Current Codebase Pattern:**
   - backtester already passes `game.date` through prediction flow
   - Just need to add schedule lookup at prediction time

### Data Pipeline
```
At Prediction Time:
  game.date = "2024-10-22"
  team = "Boston"
  
  ‚Üí Look up in nhl-202425-asplayed.csv:
    Filter: (Visitor == "Boston" OR Home == "Boston") AND Date < "2024-10-22"
    Result: Last game date = "2024-10-21"
    
  ‚Üí Calculate:
    restDays = (game.date - last_game_date).days = 1
    ‚Üí B2B detected (-3% adjustment)
    
  ‚Üí Calculate opponent rest:
    opponent_lastDate = "2024-10-20"
    restAdvantage = team_restDays - opponent_restDays = 1 - 2 = -1
    ‚Üí Opponent has advantage (-4% adjustment to Boston)
```

### Implementation Feasibility
üü¢ **MEDIUM** - Data available, need helper function
- Must build `getLastGameDate(team, currentDate)` function
- Must store game data accessible at prediction time
- In backtester: straightforward (games array available)
- In live prediction: need to load games_2024.csv on startup

### Data Gaps
‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Gap:** Live predictions (TodaysGames.jsx) don't currently have game history
   - **Workaround:** Load nhl-202425-asplayed.csv on app start (already done for teams.csv)
   - **File size:** ~50KB, negligible
   - **Already precendent:** App already loads teams.csv, goalies.csv, odds files

---

## 4. GOALIE ADJUSTMENT BY GSAE MAGNITUDE - DATA AUDIT

### Required Data
- GSAE (Goals Saved Above Expected) per goalie
- Confidence level (confirmed starter vs team average)
- Games played per goalie

### Data Available
‚úÖ **Goalie GSAE:** `public/goalies.csv`
   - Column: `goalie.xGoals - goalie.goals` = GSAE (implicit in data)
   - Already calculated in `goalieProcessor.js` line 64:
     ```javascript
     const gsae = xGoals - goalsAllowed;
     ```

‚úÖ **Games Played:** `public/goalies.csv`
   - Column: `games_played` (directly available)
   - Used to weight goalie averages: line 432 in dataProcessing.js

‚úÖ **Already Implemented:**
   - `goalieProcessor.getGoalieStats()` returns gsae
   - `goalieProcessor.getTeamGoalies()` returns array with games_played
   - `adjustForGoalie()` already calls these

### Data Pipeline
```
Current Code (dataProcessing.js line 441-456):
  if (goalieGSAE > 10) return predictedGoals * 0.85;   // Hard threshold
  if (goalieGSAE < -10) return predictedGoals * 1.15;
  return predictedGoals;

‚Üí Change to:
  const confidence = startingGoalieName ? 1.0 : 0.6;
  const adjustmentPct = (goalieGSAE * 0.10) / 100;  // 0.1% per GSAE point
  const appliedAdj = adjustmentPct * confidence;
  return Math.max(0, predictedGoals * (1 + appliedAdj));
```

### Implementation Feasibility
üü¢ **HIGH** - Data already loaded, just change adjustment logic
- No new data sources needed
- goalieProcessor.js already computes GSAE
- Just change multiplier logic

### Data Gaps
‚ùå None - all necessary goalie stats already in goalies.csv

---

## 5. LOWER EV THRESHOLD (2-4%) - DATA AUDIT

### Required Data
- Current EV calculations per game
- Configuration/threshold constants

### Data Available
‚úÖ **EV Already Calculated:**
   - `edgeCalculator.js` computes `evPercent` for each game
   - Already exposed in UI (TodaysGames.jsx)
   - No new calculations needed

‚úÖ **Threshold Currently:** 
   - Grep shows reference: likely 5-10% EV threshold
   - Just need to find current value and change

### Data Pipeline
```
Current: Filter edges where EV >= 5%
New:     Filter edges where EV >= 2%

Just adjust threshold in edgeCalculator.js (1 line change)
```

### Implementation Feasibility
üü¢ **TRIVIAL** - No data changes, just parameter
- Pure config change
- No data dependencies
- UI already displays EV percentages

### Data Gaps
‚ùå None

## MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED TO GET DATA

### For Recency Weighting
**NEW UTILITY FUNCTION NEEDED:**
```
Function: getRecentForm(team, currentDate, window=15)
Input: Team code, prediction date, lookback days
Output: Average xGF/xGA for last N games
Source: Parse nhl-202425-asplayed.csv + teams stats
Difficulty: MEDIUM - parsing/filtering logic
```

### For B2B Detection
**NEW UTILITY FUNCTION NEEDED:**
```
Function: getLastGameDate(team, currentDate)
Input: Team, current game date
Output: Last game date (or null if N/A)
Source: Parse nhl-202425-asplayed.csv
Difficulty: EASY - just sort/filter by date
```

### For Goalie Confidence
**NO NEW FUNCTION - Just modify existing:**
```
Modify: adjustForGoalie() in dataProcessing.js
Change: Replace threshold logic with magnitude-scaled logic
Difficulty: TRIVIAL - 5-line change
```

### For League Calibration
**NO NEW DATA NEEDED:**
```
Modify: calculateLeagueAverage() in dataProcessing.js
Change: Replace dynamic calc with constant
Difficulty: TRIVIAL - 1-line change
```

### For EV Threshold
**NO NEW DATA NEEDED:**
```
Modify: edgeCalculator.js
Change: Update threshold constant from 5% to 2%
Difficulty: TRIVIAL - 1-line change
```

## LIVE PREDICTION CONSIDERATION

**Current State:** App loads data once at startup
- teams.csv ‚úÖ loaded
- goalies.csv ‚úÖ loaded
- odds files ‚úÖ loaded
- **Missing:** nhl-202425-asplayed.csv (game history)

**What's Needed for Live Predictions:**
Add to app initialization (same pattern as teams.csv):
```javascript
// In App.jsx or Dashboard.jsx setup:
const gameHistory = await loadNHLGameHistory();  // Load nhl-202425-asplayed.csv
// Pass to predictors as context
```

**File Size Impact:** +50KB at startup (negligible)
**Precedent:** Already loading ~500KB teams.csv
