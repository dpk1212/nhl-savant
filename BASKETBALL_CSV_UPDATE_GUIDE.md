# Basketball Teams CSV - Daily Mapping Guide

**Last Updated:** December 3, 2025  
**Current Status:** 394+ teams mapped | 55/55 games with picks | 55/55 games with live scoring (100%)

---

## 🎯 THE NEW STREAMLINED PROCESS

Today we perfected the daily mapping workflow! Follow these 3 simple steps:

---

## STEP 1: Run Diagnostic Scripts 🔍

### Check Pick Generation (Are all games making picks?)

```bash
node scripts/diagnoseBasketballPicks.js
```

**What to look for:**
- `✅ Valid picks: X/12` - Should be 12/12
- `❌ Filtered out: Y/12` - Should be 0/12

**If any games are filtered out:**
- The script shows which teams are missing D-Ratings or Haslametrics data
- Example: `❌ Temple @ Villanova - Missing D-Ratings`

---

### Check D-Ratings Names (What are the exact names?)

```bash
node scripts/checkDRatingsParsing.js
```

**What this shows:**
- ALL team names from D-Ratings parser
- Win probabilities for verification
- Predicted scores

**Key insight:** D-Ratings includes mascots inconsistently!
- ✅ "Temple **Owls**" (has mascot)
- ✅ "Cincinnati **Bearcats**" (has mascot)
- ❌ "Alabama" (no mascot)

**Action:** Copy the EXACT name from this output into CSV column 4 (dratings_name)

---

### Check NCAA API Matching (Are live scores working?)

```bash
node scripts/checkNCAAMatching.js
```

**What to look for:**
- `✅ MATCHED - Live scores working` (good!)
- `❌ NOT MATCHED - No live scores` (needs fixing!)

**If games not matched:**
- Shows which teams need NCAA/ESPN names
- Lists exact mappings from CSV
- Identifies missing names

---

## STEP 2: Get Exact Team Names from Sources 📝

### For D-Ratings Names (Column 4):

```bash
node scripts/checkDRatingsParsing.js | grep -i "TEAM_NAME"
```

**Example:**
```
3. Temple Owls @ Villanova Wildcats
```
→ Use "Temple Owls" (not "Temple") in CSV

---

### For NCAA API Names (Column 6):

**Fetch today's NCAA API data:**
```bash
curl -s "https://ncaaproxy-lviwud3q2q-uc.a.run.app?date=YYYYMMDD" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -B5 "short"
```

Replace `YYYYMMDD` with today's date (e.g., `20251201` for Dec 1, 2025)

**What you'll see:**
```json
"names": {
    "short": "West Ga."
}
```

**Key insight:** NCAA API names can be abbreviated OR expanded from what you expect!

**Common abbreviations:**
- "West Georgia" → **"West Ga."**
- "Middle Tennessee" → **"Middle Tenn."**
- "Incarnate Word" → **"UIW"**
- "McNeese State" → **"McNeese"**
- "Ball State" → **"Ball St."**
- "Eastern Michigan" → **"Eastern Mich."**
- "Georgia State" → **"Georgia St."**
- "St. John's" → **"St. John's (NY)"**

**Common expansions (name is LONGER than expected):**
- "Army" → **"Army West Point"**
- "Miami OH" → **"Miami (OH)"**
- "UNC Wilmington" → **"UNCW"**

**CRITICAL:** The fuzzy matcher requires 80% length similarity. If the NCAA API
name is much longer or shorter than what's in the CSV, matching WILL fail silently
(no live scores). Always verify by fetching the API directly.

**Action:** Copy the exact `"short"` name into CSV column 6 (ncaa_name)

---

### For Haslametrics Names (Column 3):

```bash
grep -i "TEAM_NAME" public/haslametrics.md | head -3
```

**What to look for:**
- Team links like: `[Temple](https://haslametrics.com/...)`
- Use the exact text between `[` and `]`

---

## STEP 3: Fix the CSV 🔧

### CSV Structure (10 columns):
```csv
normalized_name,oddstrader_name,haslametrics_name,dratings_name,conference,ncaa_name,notes,espn_name,barttorvik_name,odds_api_name
```

### Example Fix:

**Before (broken):**
```csv
Temple,Temple,Temple,Temple,TBD,Temple,✓,Temple
```

**After (working):**
```csv
Temple,Temple,Temple,Temple Owls,TBD,Temple,✓,Temple
```

**What changed:** Column 4 (dratings_name) now has "Temple Owls" (with mascot)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### Rule 1: EXACT MATCH REQUIRED
- Copy names EXACTLY as parsers return them
- Capitalization matters!
- Spaces matter!
- Periods matter!

### Rule 2: Five Name Columns to Update

| Column | Source | Example | Common Mistakes |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **3** | Haslametrics | `Temple` | Usually simple, but check for abbreviations |
| **4** | D-Ratings | `Temple Owls` | ⚠️ Includes mascots (sometimes!) |
| **6** | NCAA API | `Army West Point` | ⚠️ Abbreviated OR expanded! See below |
| **8** | ESPN API | `Temple` | Usually matches display name |
| **9** | Barttorvik | `Temple` | Usually matches normalized name |

### Rule 3: Check for Duplicates FIRST

```bash
grep -i "TEAM_NAME" public/basketball_teams.csv
```

**If team exists:**
- ✅ Update the existing row
- ❌ DON'T add a new row (causes conflicts)

**If team is truly missing:**
- ✅ Add at end of file
- ✅ Mark with "NEW" in notes column

### Rule 4: Mascot Detection

D-Ratings is INCONSISTENT with mascots:

**WITH mascots:**
- "Temple Owls"
- "Cincinnati Bearcats"
- "Troy Trojans"
- "West Georgia Wolves"

**WITHOUT mascots:**
- "Alabama"
- "Kansas"
- "Texas"

**How to know:** Run `checkDRatingsParsing.js` and copy EXACTLY what you see!

### Rule 5: NCAA API Names (Not Always Abbreviations!)

NCAA API `names.short` can be abbreviated, expanded, or have qualifiers:

| Our Name | NCAA API `names.short` | Issue |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| West Georgia | `West Ga.` | Abbreviated |
| Middle Tennessee | `Middle Tenn.` | Abbreviated |
| Incarnate Word | `UIW` | Acronym |
| McNeese State | `McNeese` | Dropped "State" |
| **Army** | **`Army West Point`** | **Expanded** (WILL break matching!) |
| St. John's | `St. John's (NY)` | Added qualifier |
| Miami OH | `Miami (OH)` | Different format |
| Ball State | `Ball St.` | Abbreviated |
| Eastern Michigan | `Eastern Mich.` | Abbreviated |
| North Carolina A&T | `N.C. A&T` | Abbreviated |

**The fuzzy matcher has an 80% length ratio requirement.** If "Army" (4 chars) is in
the CSV but the API returns "Army West Point" (15 chars), the ratio is 27% — match
fails silently and live scores won't appear.

**How to know:** Check the NCAA API endpoint directly!

---

## STEP 4: Verify the Fixes ✅

### Test Pick Generation:
```bash
node scripts/diagnoseBasketballPicks.js | tail -10
```

**Expected:** `✅ Valid picks: 12/12`

### Test NCAA Matching:
```bash
node scripts/checkNCAAMatching.js | tail -10
```

**Expected:** `✅ Matched: 11/12 games` (or 12/12 if all games in NCAA API)

### Test End-to-End:
```bash
npm run write-basketball-bets
```

**Expected:** All 12 games should generate picks with proper unit allocation

## 📊 Today's Fixes (Dec 1, 2025)

### Problem 1: Missing D-Ratings Mappings (5 games)

**Root Cause:** CSV had names WITHOUT mascots, D-Ratings returns WITH mascots

**Fixed:**
1. Temple → **Temple Owls**
2. Bowling Green → **Bowling Green Falcons**
3. Jacksonville State → **Jacksonville State Gamecocks**
4. Cincinnati → **Cincinnati Bearcats**
5. Troy → **Troy Trojans**

**Result:** 7/12 → 12/12 games generating picks ✅

---

### Problem 2: Missing NCAA API Mappings (4 games)

**Root Cause:** CSV had full names, NCAA API returns abbreviated names

**Fixed:**
1. West Georgia → **West Ga.**
2. Middle Tennessee (MTSU) → **Middle Tenn.**
3. Incarnate Word → **UIW**

**Result:** 8/12 → 11/12 games with live scoring ✅

(South Carolina State @ Chicago State not in NCAA API today - not a mapping issue)

## 🛠️ Diagnostic Tools Reference

### Core Scripts (run these daily):

| Script | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `diagnoseBasketballPicks.js` | Shows which games generate picks | ALWAYS run first |
| `checkDRatingsParsing.js` | Shows exact D-Ratings names | When games filtered out |
| `checkNCAAMatching.js` | Shows NCAA API matching | When live scores missing |

### Helper Scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `testNCAANames.js` | Fetches live NCAA API data |
| `verifyTodaysMappings.js` | Verifies all teams exist in CSV |

---

## 🎯 Quick Reference: Common Fixes

### Haslametrics Abbreviations:
- "Southeast Missouri State" → `SE Missouri St.`
- "University of Massachusetts Lowell" → `UMass Lowell`
- "Jacksonville State" → `Jacksonville St.`

### D-Ratings Mascots:
- Run `checkDRatingsParsing.js` and copy EXACTLY what you see
- No pattern - some have mascots, some don't
- NEVER guess - always verify!

### NCAA API Abbreviations:
- Check endpoint: `https://ncaaproxy-lviwud3q2q-uc.a.run.app?date=YYYYMMDD`
- Look for `"names": { "short": "..." }`
- Common patterns: "St." for State, "Tenn." for Tennessee, acronyms for long names

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Only X/12 games generating picks"

**Solution:**
1. Run `diagnoseBasketballPicks.js`
2. Note which games are filtered out
3. Run `checkDRatingsParsing.js` to see exact names
4. Update CSV column 4 (dratings_name) with exact names
5. Re-run diagnostic

---

### Issue: "Live scores not working for some games"

**Solution:**
1. Run `checkNCAAMatching.js`
2. Note which games show "NOT MATCHED"
3. Fetch NCAA API: `curl -s "https://ncaaproxy-lviwud3q2q-uc.a.run.app?date=YYYYMMDD"`
4. Find the exact `"short"` names in the JSON
5. Update CSV column 6 (ncaa_name) with exact names
6. Re-run diagnostic

---

### Issue: "Duplicate team entries"

**Solution:**
1. Search CSV: `grep -i "TEAM_NAME" public/basketball_teams.csv`
2. If duplicate found, delete the old/incorrect row
3. Keep the row with most complete data
4. Never have multiple rows with same oddstrader_name (column 2)

---

## 🚀 Daily Workflow (The Easy Way!)

### Every Morning:

```bash
# 1. Fetch fresh data
npm run fetch-basketball

# 2. Check if all games work
node scripts/diagnoseBasketballPicks.js

# 3. If any issues, fix and verify
node scripts/checkDRatingsParsing.js  # for missing picks
node scripts/checkNCAAMatching.js      # for missing live scores

# 4. Update CSV as needed (see steps above)

# 5. Final verification
node scripts/diagnoseBasketballPicks.js | tail -5

# 6. Push to GitHub
git add public/basketball_teams.csv
git commit -m "Basketball CSV: Daily mapping update [DATE]"
git push origin main
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ 12/12 games generating picks
- ✅ 11-12/12 games with live scoring (depending on NCAA API coverage)
- ✅ All bets written to Firebase
- ✅ Site refreshes with new data

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Save time:** Run all diagnostic scripts FIRST before making any changes
2. **Verify sources:** Always check parser output, never guess names
3. **Test incrementally:** Fix 1-2 teams, test, then continue
4. **Keep notes:** Mark new teams with "NEW" in column 7
5. **Use grep:** Search CSV before adding any team to avoid duplicates

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics

You know the mapping is complete when:

- ✅ `diagnoseBasketballPicks.js` shows 12/12 valid picks
- ✅ `checkNCAAMatching.js` shows 11-12/12 matched games
